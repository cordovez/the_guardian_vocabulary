You will read the grim facts about Chanel Sultan’s life in a minute, but first let’s talk about her dreams. Like the law degree she has just started, or her hope to buy her own home. Like her years spent driving buses by day and working on her construction business in the evenings, all to feed her three children. Like reading self-help books and doing penance at the gym. “We can live lives that we really want to live,” she says. “Not the ones we’ve been given.” We sit in a house so run-down it laughs at any dreams, and I can’t tell whether such faith is born of determination or delusion. ou will read the grim facts about Chanel Sultan’s life in a minute, but first let’s talk about her dreams.

Like reading self-help books and doing penance at the gym. “We can live lives that we really want to live,” she says. “Not the ones we’ve been given.” We sit in a house so run-down it laughs at any dreams, and I can’t tell whether such faith is born of determination or delusion. At night she can hear rats scratching around beneath the floorboards under her bed. She and her children have seen them scuttling about and found their rotting corpses, have even had their belongings chewed up. Over the few months they have lived in this Victorian terrace, the ferocious damp and mould have ruined their clothes and their furniture. The headboard and base of Sultan’s own bed are so spoilt that they have been thrown away. In her bedroom, the mattress now sits atop cardboard packing boxes. For the past few months, I have been talking with Sultan about this home that feels anything but homely. I’ve seen dozens of photos and videos of what she found on moving in last summer: exterior doors that don’t lock, electric wiring exposed, rat droppings everywhere and a toilet bowl encrusted with faeces. And I’ve read emails and letters and all the back-and-forth as she’s tried to get things fixed. With only partial success: visiting last week, I saw the damp on the walls, the plugged up rat holes, and, in the garden, the big black traps warning of poison inside. This squalor was supposed to be her fresh start. After some hard years, the 38-year-old had just got remarried and fancied a new life in the suburbs of London. On viewing, she’d had some worries, but the family were assured that central heating and double glazing would arrive at the property before they did. They were even asked to pick a colour for the new door. And since those promises came from the country’s biggest housing association, Clarion, Sultan believed them. Bad move. Not only were the works not done, but the previous resident left behind decades’ worth of belongings. More extraordinary still was Clarion’s response. Because Sultan had swapped with another tenant to move into the home, the housing association quoted the law that said it was up to the two of them to sort out the mess. After Sultan pleaded with the previous tenant, they moved everything – as far as the front yard. Some promised work was done but on other jobs Sultan kept getting fobbed off. The filth drove the family to angry rows. Her eldest daughter moved out, while her teenage son tried sofa-surfing. The baby of the family, a shy fawn of a girl still in primary school, kept breaking down in tears. A longtime sufferer of poor mental health, Sultan felt herself slide into despair. In emails she sent to the housing association, which I have seen, she reports a manager shouting down the phone: “I don’t care about your mental health, your mental health condition has nothing to do with the house,” and: “You will live there with the rats until we come and get rid of them.”She tried to kill herself three times. After walking out into oncoming traffic, she wrote to Clarion: “I want to take my life. I am just too sad … I don’t think I will ever be helped or understood.” The reply began: “I’m sorry to hear that the messages you received from [the previous tenant] caused you to want to end your life.”When I contacted Clarion, it said: “We sincerely apologise to Ms Sultan. Every resident should be treated fairly, with respect and compassion.” It disputes some parts of her story that I haven’t mentioned, yet adds: “We are determined to continuously improve the service we provide and we will learn from this case.”It has made several similar statements over the past couple of years, as stories of appalling treatment of other tenants are splashed on telly or brought to regulators. At the offices of Sultan’s Tory MP, Stephen Hammond, staff have to deal with Clarion on residents’ behalf every day. In the constituency next door, Labour’s Siobhain McDonagh made the papers in 2021 for estimating Clarion comprised half her casework. It’s just as high today, the MP tells me: “I don’t think that their tenants and leaseholders will have seen any improvement.”We could park all this at the door of a housing association that is too big to fail, yet is a serial failure. Its board features such establishment figures as Gavin Barwell, the housing minister just before Grenfell went up in flames, as well as big names who worked at Rothschild and Savills – but not one tenant. The chief executive of this charity, Clare Miller, took home over £369,000 last year. Yet, ultimately, Chanel Sultan has been failed by a society that scarcely notices people like her, let alone protects their rights. The weekend papers carry their property supplements, the BBC brings you Homes Under the Hammer. No such loving attention is paid to the 4 million households in England alone who rent from a housing association or a council. For this piece, the Guardian’s archivists went through five years of national newspaper stories and totted up how many focused on social housing. In a period that includes the aftermath of Grenfell, the cladding scandal and the death of the toddler Awaab Ishak from respiratory failure in a mould-infested home, there were 1,315 reports. Over the same period there were 6,312 articles – five times as many – on house prices alone. In a country sharply divided between those who own assets and those who don’t, the media and political system stands squarely behind the asset-owners. Looking at the first year of the pandemic for her new book, Stay Home, Prof Becky Tunstall documents how far the then chancellor Rishi Sunak and the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, went to prop up the housing market: cuts in stamp duty, mortgage holidays, lower interest rates, quantitative easing. The expensive medicine worked a treat. Where house prices had been forecast to plunge, the average home instead rocketed by £37,000 in one year. For households, she calculates, that sum “dwarfed” the value of furlough, help for the self-employed and the uplift for universal credit. Meanwhile, renters are so unprotected that, to get a home fit for a human, Sultan had to go to superhuman lengths: numerous emails to Clarion, to the regulators, taking on solicitors, even complaining on TikTok – for which she was hit with a letter from Clarion’s lawyers, even as its contractors set about doing more repairs. Hours after receiving my questions, the housing association got in touch with the family again – even offering to proof the house against rats. Clarion says: “We are pleased that the majority of work is now complete, with full completion due next week.”Sultan reads books with titles such as Think and Grow Rich, yet the lives of her and her children have been stunted by not being rich – and no amount of magical thinking will change that. In a society that tells everyone they can be whatever they want, she still aspires to be an entrepreneur, but she and her family have learned the hard way that promises are not reality. “I feel like I’m a prisoner of my circumstances,” she says. “Like, if you’re not a certain class, you’re not taken seriously.” Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans. org or jo@samaritans. ie.

Fringe forces of the far left are plotting to take away our freedom to be stuck in traffic jams, to crawl along clogged ring roads and trawl the streets in search of a parking spot. The liberty of the rush-hour commute, the sanctity of the out-of-town shopping centre and the righteousness of the suburban food desert is under threat as never before. The name of this chilling global movement? The “15-minute city”.Westminster can often seem like a badly scripted spoof of itself, but rarely has parliament descended into parody as far as it did last week, when the Conservative MP for the South Yorkshire constituency of Don Valley, Nick Fletcher, launched a plucky tirade against the concept of convenient, walkable neighbourhoods. “Will the leader of the house please set aside time for a debate on the international socialist concept of so-called 15-minute cities and 20-minute neighbourhoods?” he asked, in an ominous tone. “Sheffield is already on this journey, and I do not want Doncaster, which also has a Labour-run socialist council, to do the same.”It is not the first time that an online conspiracy theory has made it into the Commons chamber, but it may be one of the most surreal. Simply put, the 15-minute city principle suggests you should have your daily needs – work, food, healthcare, education, culture and leisure – within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from where you live. It sounds pleasant enough, but in the minds of libertarian fanatics and the bedroom commentators of TikTok, it represents an unprecedented assault on personal freedoms.“Creepy local authority bureaucrats would like to see your entire existence boiled down to the duration of a quarter of an hour,” warned a furious presenter on GB News last week, as if describing a plot line from Nineteen Eighty-Four. The 15-minute city, he suggested, was a “dystopian plan”, heralding “a surveillance culture that would make Pyongyang envious”.Never before has a mundane theory of urbanism been such a lightning rod for outrage. It’s like suggesting that public parks are part of a sinister plant-worshipping plot to demolish our homes and replace them with grass. Or that public transport is the work of a satanic bus cult. Some online forums have claimed that the 15-minute city represents the first step towards an inevitable Hunger Games society, in which residents will not be allowed to leave their prescribed areas. They see it not as a route to a low-traffic, low-carbon future, but as the beginning of a slippery slope to living in an open-air prison. As one irate TikToker shrieked, while jumping around his room in disbelief: “You’re going to have to apply for a fucking permit to leave your zone!” (Although he also ascribed the 15-minute city plans to the Tories, so it’s not quite clear which deranged Reddit forum he got his information from).There are lots of good reasons to interrogate the cute logic of the 15-minute city – could it actually lead to further social segregation? Would wealthy residents, and their money, remain in the prosperous enclaves? Who is providing the services and where do they live? – but the threat of our rights being curtailed by travel permits isn’t one of them. The conspiracy theory pot was given a powerful stir in December, when the Canadian rightwing culture warrior Jordan Peterson decided to get involved. “The idea that neighbourhoods should be walkable is lovely,” he tweeted, in a post that has since clocked up 7. 5m views. “The idea that idiot tyrannical bureaucrats can decide by fiat where you’re ‘allowed’ to drive is perhaps the worst imaginable perversion of that idea,” he continued, “and, make no mistake, it’s part of a well-documented plan.” Peterson quoted a tweet that featured the telltale hashtag #GreatReset, referring to the World Economic Forum’s post-pandemic economic recovery plan – widely used in the stranger corners of the internet as a byword for a shadowy global conspiracy intent on robbing us of our freedoms. The anti-vaccine, pro-Brexit, climate-denying, 15-minute-phobe, Great Reset axis is a strong one. So where did the fear come from? Many of the UK conspiracy theorists highlight that these “un-British” ideas of urban walkability emanate from France, so they must be distrusted on principle. Worse than that, they point out, the ideology has been driven by a bearded Colombian scientist with radical roots. The ideas had been around since the 1920s, but the 15-minute city phrase was coined by Carlos Moreno, esteemed professor at the Panthéon-Sorbonne in Paris, who was once a member of a leftwing guerrilla group in the 1970s. And now he’s coming for your cars.“Their lies are enormous,” Moreno said in a recent interview , describing some of the claims made by his critics. “You will be locked in your neighbourhood; cameras will signal who can go out; if your mother lives in another neighbourhood, you will have to ask for permission to see her, and so on,” adding that they “sometimes post pictures of concentration camps.”Moreno first promoted his concept of la ville du quart d’heure in 2016, but it gained international attention when the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, adopted it as part of her re-election campaign in 2020. She promised she would close off roads and turn them into public plazas, plant more trees and turn schools into the “capitals of the neighbourhood”, open to everyone for sports and recreation in evenings and at weekends. The pandemic proved to be a powerful trial for how a 15-minute city might work in practice, and led to bodies such as UN Habitat, the World Economic Forum, the C40 Global Cities Climate Network and the Federation of United Local Governments championing the cause – which also helped to boost unhinged fantasies that it is all part of a grand global scheme of totalitarian oppression. More recently, the principles have gained traction in the UK, with Oxford, Birmingham, Bristol, Canterbury and Sheffield councils considering 15-minute city ideas. Cue outrage from those with no other cause left to flog. “The climate change lockdowns are coming,” tweeted Nigel Farage, in response to Canterbury’s innocuous traffic filtering scheme, while Oxford’s plans triggered similar ripples of incredulous fury.“Oxfordshire County Council yesterday approved plans to lock residents into one of six zones to ‘save the planet’ from global warming,” screamed one alarmist headline. “The latest stage in the ‘15-minute city’ agenda is to place electronic gates on key roads in and out of the city, confining residents to their own neighbourhoods.” The claims had zero basis in fact, but they poured further fuel on the fire of those battling low-traffic neighbourhoods, and their fellow band of assorted culture warriors. It seems fitting that a leaflet drop warning against Oxford’s traffic filters plan was organised by Not Our Future – a new pressure group led by none other than Fred and Richard Fairbrass of 1990s band turned anti-vaxxers Right Said Fred.

An independent Scotland has not been hindered by Nicola Sturgeon’s departure; it could well be advanced by it. Her eight years as first minister have been remarkable, but failed to bring statehood closer to reality. The question is whether her intransigence postponed it. n independent Scotland has not been hindered by Nicola Sturgeon’s departure; it could well be advanced by it. Her eight years as first minister have been remarkable, but failed to bring statehood closer to reality. The question is whether her intransigence postponed it. Sturgeon made a strategic error after her predecessor Alex Salmond lost the 2014 independence referendum. She assumed her charisma could swiftly erode the 55% turnout for continued union with England and secure a victorious rerun of the poll. Despite her electoral successes, she never seriously dented that majority. All Sturgeon could do was plunge an ever more visceral anti-Englishness into courtroom battles with London that she was never likely to win. Salmond had in 2014 foolishly rejected David Cameron’s offer of a second referendum option for so-called “devo max”, a radically enhanced Scottish autonomy. This would certainly have passed, with polls indicating 66% support among Scottish voters. While devo max was a constitutional can of worms, it could not have been wished away. It should have begun a drastic restructuring of the Scottish economy away from dependence on – and therefore control from – London. At very least it would have put serious autonomy within the realm of plausibility. The question now is how far could a new SNP leader take such a move towards greater autonomy forward, possibly aided by sensible and open-minded leaders of the Labour and Tory parties. To Sturgeon, the issue bordered on the theological. As with Salmond, it was freedom or bust, independence or serfdom. They wanted their own currency, their own debt, a hard border with England, membership of the EU and no UK weapons on Scottish soil. This was fantasy enough but at no point did it engage in the elephant in the independence room – economics. Gazing across the Irish Sea, we can all study Ireland’s experience since independence a century ago, when under British rule it was among the poorest nations in Europe. Depending on definition, it is today one of the most prosperous. But it took Dublin 50 years of austerity and pain – including a meagre welfare state – to get there. Not until the 1980s did it achieve such key indicators of growth as a net inflow of investment, population and talent, and “Celtic tiger” status. There is no tartan tiger. Sturgeon’s leadership enabled the Scots to have their cake and eat it. Her fierce nationalism gave voters emotional satisfaction. She ran hospitals, schools, trains, law and order, while Covid gave Scotland a degree of administrative discretion. Limited scope to raise top income taxes allowed a generous family support package and free student tuition. But this did not deliver the Scottish people conspicuously better services, and it depended heavily on an annual subsidy from London. Scotland’s budget deficit in 2020-21 of 22% of GDP was among the largest of any nation in the western world, though surging oil and gas revenues have recently cut it back. Similarly sized Denmark runs a surplus of 4%. The annual UK government grant to Scotland announced last October was a record £41bn. This is money a Scottish treasury would have to find on its own, which is why Scotland’s standard of living needs union into the foreseeable future. As Ireland shows, there is a path out of dependency, but it is neither easy nor swift. Federal constitutions in Spain, Switzerland and Germany indicate that the key to autonomy lies in fiscal freedom, in the capacity to grow, earn and spend, independent of policies ordained by a central government. The Basques and the Swiss cantons enjoy fiscal discretions unthinkable to the British Treasury – but the key lies in fiscal self-sufficiency. Advocates of independence persistently fail to confront this. There is no reason why Scotland cannot approach the prosperity of Ireland or Scandinavia. Decades of reliance on the most centralist political economy in Europe – that of the UK – have crippled Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Devo max might aim to embrace some of Ireland’s libertarian taxes along with Norway’s links to the EU’s single market. It might conceivably join with Northern Ireland in its revitalised Brexit protocol, ingeniously returning to the EU’s trading regime and yet free to trade with England. A digital border would be complicated, as Ireland is showing, but it would honour the clear vote of a majority of Scots against Brexit. The concept of devo max – so-called “full fiscal autonomy” or “radical federalism” – is now debated by many on the fringes of the independence debate, in Wales as well as Scotland. The effort is to move forward from political confrontation. Federalism covers a spectrum of options but its purpose is to offer Scotland a freer hand to raise and spend public money, while offering London relief from a heavy burden in Scotland. It would be what Ireland was denied by England in the 19th century, true home rule under the crown. Had it been granted, the old United Kingdom might still be one. As for Sturgeon’s successor, such an outcome could deliver a new Scotland mercifully at peace with London. Or it could prepare a path to full independence if that were, in my view sadly, to be Scotland’s eventual choice. Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist Pulling into a service station to listen to Nicola Sturgeon’s resignation speech on Wednesday morning, I was hit by a wave of sadness. It wasn’t that the first minister’s departure was unexpected. Though the precise timing was a shock, she has been visibly flagging for months, and her popularity has been waning even among SNP diehards. “She’s lost the room,” one loyalist told me recently. When Jacinda Ardern – a politician Sturgeon greatly admires – stepped down as the prime minister of New Zealand with the words: “We give all that we can for as long as we can. And then it’s time,” I imagined Sturgeon thinking: “That’s the way to do it.”ulling into a service station to listen to Nicola Sturgeon’s resignation speech on Wednesday morning, I was hit by a wave of sadness.

When Jacinda Ardern – a politician Sturgeon greatly admires – stepped down as the prime minister of New Zealand with the words: “We give all that we can for as long as we can. And then it’s time,” I imagined Sturgeon thinking: “That’s the way to do it.”Nor am I blind to the chequered nature of the first minister’s legacy. It has been disappointing to watch a woman who came to power with such noble aspirations fail to deliver on a succession of pledges, such as closing the educational attainment gap, and become mired in a succession of controversies, such as the ferry fiasco and the “missing” £600,000 of SNP funds. Yet her speech – and the poise with which she delivered it – brought back all that was good about her leadership: the almost Calvinist sense of duty, the relatability, the humility. These are qualities absent in the five UK prime ministers who have been in office as she attempted to steer her ship through the choppy waters that their greed and populism created. Sturgeon has her own character flaws. Her cautious nature has had a dampening effect on her radicalism, and her reluctance to listen to anyone outside her inner circle led to errors of judgment on the “named person” legislation, which was later found to breach children’s right to privacy, and on the gender recognition reform bill, which Rishi Sunak blocked in a historic challenge to Scottish devolution. Still, if Boris Johnson, Liz Truss or Sunak had possessed a fraction of Sturgeon’s integrity, there would have been no Brexit, no support for bankers’ bonuses and no hint of tax avoidance. And if they had acknowledged the SNP’s overwhelming mandate for a second independence referendum, she would not now be facing criticism for failing to secure one. Furthermore, while Sturgeon’s policies may not have been ambitious enough for those on the left of the SNP, Scotland’s tax system is the most progressive in the UK, and the Conservatives’ welfare reforms are being mitigated by the child payment – £25 per child per week for low-income families. Sturgeon made enemies on both sides of the constitutional divide. Sometimes it felt like she couldn’t win. But the sight of her, eloquent and self-reflective at the podium brought back her finest hour: guiding Scotland through the pandemic. There were mistakes there, too, of course, most notably the release of untested hospital patients into care homes. But her messaging was always clear and direct, and you never doubted she cared or that she was giving her all. You could no more imagine Sturgeon socialising while other people mourned alone than you could imagine Johnson stacking chairs at the end of a political meeting (something Sturgeon was wont to do even as first minister). Or resigning gracefully in the interests of his party and his country. Her speech was also a reminder of how she transformed the landscape. When I returned to Scotland from England in 1996, politics and journalism was male-dominated, with female voices pushed to the margins. Sturgeon changed all that, not merely by being a woman at the helm (after all, there have been two female prime ministers during her time in power), but by actively promoting gender equality. Her government’s handling of the initial allegations against Alex Salmond, and the inquiry that followed, almost proved her undoing. But the impulse to change the sexual harassment complaints process came from a place of principle; and she stuck to those principles despite the outpouring of vitriol and misogyny they unleashed. Though Sturgeon insists the fallout from the GRR bill was not the catalyst for her departure, the accusation that she has squandered her right to be considered a feminist must be painful. The timing of her resignation appears to have more to do with the forthcoming conference on “election-based options” designed to force the UK government into negotiations on independence. Sturgeon knows her preferred option – turning the general election into a de facto referendum – is divisive. “And I cannot in good conscience ask the party to choose an option based on my judgment, whilst not being convinced that I would be there as leader to see it through,” she explained. “Conscience”: there’s a concept that’s been in short supply these last 10 years. I admire Sturgeon for not clinging too desperately to her dream of personally delivering independence. It must be tough to give up something that has consumed so much of your life – although it may be easier to cede power if you have not desired it for its own sake, but as a means of securing an ideal that transcends your own ego. I admire her, too, for not believing she is indispensable; for having faith in the next generation of SNP politicians. My service station sadness was part ruefulness for what might have been, part fear there was no one else capable of filling her shoes. It’s impossible to conceive of any of the touted contenders – Kate Forbes, Keith Brown, Neil Gray – filling stadiums full of selfie-seeking fans. But while Sturgeon’s competence was established before she became first minister, her popularity was a product of timing; she rode into town on a post-referendum high. Whoever succeeds her will have to make their own luck, to rethink the party’s entire strategy and approach. That may be no bad thing.

The political vultures have been circling Nicola Sturgeon for several weeks now. But her resignation as first minister and leader of the SNP still comes as a lightning bolt from a not especially threatening Scottish political sky. It is certain to trigger the biggest convulsion in Scottish politics since the independence referendum of 2014, and its implications will be felt across the electoral and constitutional politics of the whole UK too. he political vultures have been circling Nicola Sturgeon for several weeks now. But her resignation as first minister and leader of the SNP still comes as a lightning bolt from a not especially threatening Scottish political sky. It is certain to trigger the biggest convulsion in Scottish politics since the independence referendum of 2014, and its implications will be felt across the electoral and constitutional politics of the whole UK too. Sturgeon’s resignation statement at Bute House today showed why she will be such a formidable act to follow, and also why it is time for her to go. She had much to say, about Scotland, independence, Covid and political life, which was as eloquently done as ever. But her speech, perhaps like her leadership, went on too long. Even as she spoke, you could sense that the political world was cruelly turning to consider the post-Sturgeon era. It has been a commonplace among those who track Scottish politics that Sturgeon has been in what one columnist called her late imperial phase for many months. She had begun to lose her touch – and hence her hold – especially when compared with her mother-of-the-nation mastery during Covid. Even within the ranks of her Scottish National party, the most self-disciplined and tongue-holding political force in these islands outside Sinn Féin, criticisms and disagreements were being voiced. Sturgeon’s departure emerges from a constellation of proximate causes. Her handling of Scotland’s new gender recognition laws – unpopular with the majority of Scots – has been uncharacteristically heavy footed. Her strategy on independence – still the central divide in Scottish politics – has been heading into a constitutional cul-de-sac. Her domestic record as first minister has come under unusually intense and scathing challenge. Her performances in the Holyrood parliament and in her recent press conferences have been second rate, especially from a political leader who was once such an accomplished public performer. In the end, though, she is surely also going for the reason that she tried to put at the centre of her resignation speech. She has been SNP leader and first minister for eight years now, since succeeding Alex Salmond. She was Salmond’s deputy for nearly eight years before that. There is no ideal number of years for a leader to serve, but Sturgeon’s 16 years – like those of Angela Merkel – are surely too much. As Jacinda Ardern put it, she simply doesn’t have enough left in the tank. Sturgeon’s departure triggers a leadership contest between contenders who possess only a fraction of her name and brand recognition. The contest will not be like 2014, when Sturgeon was the self-evident SNP leader in waiting. Sturgeon is said to believe that Kate Forbes, the Scottish finance secretary, possesses, as Napoleon once put it, a marshal’s baton in her knapsack. Forbes is talented but she is also relatively untested. She also comes from a much less liberal progressive background than either Sturgeon or Salmond. Her views on abortion and gender recognition are not Sturgeon’s. It would be ironic if these views equipped Forbes to reach across the political divide in the way that Sturgeon said today she herself could no longer do. In the short run, Sturgeon’s successor must navigate what will now be a much less predictable SNP special conference next month on independence strategy. Sturgeon made a point of saying in her resignation speech that her departure would free the SNP to choose its path. But this will not be easy or necessarily successful. The SNP stands or falls on independence. In the medium term, Sturgeon’s departure robs the SNP of its greatest individual electoral asset. It would be outrageous to claim that the SNP has been a one-woman band, any more than it was a one-man band under Salmond. But the SNP always put Sturgeon front and centre of all its electoral campaigns, and without her there will not be the same allure and confidence. For that reason, today was a very good day for Scottish Labour and for Keir Starmer, who will see their general election chances boosted. In the long run, though, the big question posed by Sturgeon’s resignation is whether this is the watershed moment for the independence cause that unionists quietly crave and nationalists, if they are frank, still fear. Does her departure mean, and reflect the fact, that the nationalist tide has passed its high point? Is the United Kingdom a little more secure tonight with Sturgeon’s going than it was when she was in the ascendancy? Many will think that the answer is yes. But many have been wrong about this very subject before.

Sometimes it’s a strange mist that descends out of nowhere. In an increasing number of cases, an object that can’t be seen with the naked eye shows up clearly in a photographic image. These are examples of UFOs – literally, unidentified flying objects – that are spotted in UK skies every day. In the wake of the US shooting down a suspected Chinese spy balloon, plus three other objects it has yet to identify, experts say there are going to be a lot more of these kinds of sightings. As a UFO researcher, I treat these things with scepticism and scientific rigour, but part of me hopes they will never be fully explained. As the head of national investigations for the British UFO Research Association (Bufora), I’m one of a team of people who investigate such sightings, which are sent to us by the public at a rate of hundreds a year. Often they come as grainy mobile phone footage taken at dusk or from a moving car, but we also require witnesses to fill in a detailed form explaining what they saw, heard, felt and even smelled at the time of the event. We promise to treat sightings confidentially, objectively and with scientific rigour. In 98% of cases, we find they have a simple explanation. Typically, when we receive a report at Bufora, I take a look and pass it on to our photographic analyst, Mark Easen. Objects most commonly turn out to be drones, aircraft (sometimes military aircraft), satellites, meteors, balloons, lanterns or birds. When Elon Musk’s SpaceX first launched its Starlink satellites in 2019, we were inundated with sightings of small pinpricks of light moving steadily across the night sky, sometimes 50 or 100 at a time. By finding out where witnesses are at the time and what airports, military bases or other facilities are nearby, we can usually identify the objects they’ve observed. It’s important to know what they’ve seen with the naked eye, because often a UFO will turn out to be a speck of dust on the camera lens, a tiny insect flying into shot or the reflection of a seatbelt buckle in a car window. First, we rule out the obvious. If it looks like a plane and flies like a plane, it’s usually a plane. Reports follow patterns and trends that reflect the changing media landscape. In our not-too-distant past, unexplainable phenomena tended to be reported as fairies or goblins – things people saw in the folklore and mythology of the day. Now, sci-fi books and films affect the way people interpret what they have seen. There’s a particular type of sighting that we call high strangeness sightings (HSS), when someone feels they have been up close and personal with something of unknown origin – and during the 1990s, when The X-Files was hugely influential, as many as 8% of sightings reported to us were HSS. They’re usually rare, but I saw them increase again during lockdown. People were scared, and understandably so. I became interested in space when I lived in the US in the 1970s and early 80s, where my dad was an aeronautical engineer for Nasa. But I’ve always been interested in extraordinary human experiences – things outside the boundaries of what we understand. The UFO subject embraces a huge and diverse landscape: science, religion, folklore and myth, the paranormal, neuroscience and philosophy. I’ve learned a lot about the way memory works: once you lay down an experience into long-term memory, each time you access that memory it is slightly edited. You add to it things you’ve seen, conversations you’ve had, a TV programme you saw. I never think people are foolish when they report a UFO; I’m just fascinated by the ways we interpret reality. I’m often asked what I believe about extraterrestrial life, and whether it will ever make contact. After all, about 2% of the UFOs we hear about can’t be identified – yet. In all the years I’ve spent looking at the evidence, I have never seen any definitive proof that a UFO has been extraterrestrial in origin, but I don’t close my mind to the possibility. I’m sceptical – to do this work properly I have to be. But, as JBS Haldane wrote: “It is my suspicion that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.”Personally, I think there will be a rational explanation for the objects that have been shot down by the US military recently. But there are still mysteries, and I think there always will be. I wonder what narratives humans will invent to explain the sightings of tomorrow, and what science fiction will come up with next. Will science and expert analysis be able to explain all of these things, eventually? I suspect not. I hope not.

Instead, he was stabbed to death in a park on his way home from a night out. It wasn’t an isolated incident.

Instead, he was stabbed to death in a park on his way home from a night out. It wasn’t an isolated incident. In the weeks surrounding his murder, gangs followed refugee children to and from school – one five-year-old boy was attacked with a baseball bat, according to an anti-racist campaign group – while hundreds of local residents held angry protests at the housing of asylum seekers in their deprived neighbourhood. This is exactly the kind of violent escalation that many must fear happening after the riot in Knowsley last Friday. In fact, Dag’s murder took place more than 20 years ago, in Glasgow in the summer of 2001. Then, as now, inflammatory political rhetoric played a part: in the early 2000s, Britain was in the grips of a tabloid-driven moral panic over asylum. Far-right groups were also trying to whip up anti-refugee sentiment, holding demonstrations in other parts of the country. A xenophobic backlash is always a risk when immigration becomes a fought-over political issue. Britain is not alone in that: in recent months Ireland has seen attempts by its tiny far-right scene, sensing an opportunity in tough economic times to stir up resentment of asylum seekers. But while politicians are rightly criticised when they pick up far-right talking points, there is another, underlying source of trouble here – the asylum system itself. For more than two decades, the British state has aimed to keep people seeking refuge walled off from the rest of society. They are banned from working while they wait for their claims to be heard and must subsist on meagre payments administered by the Home Office – £45 a week, or £9. 10 if placed in a hotel – in parallel to the regular benefits system. Unless they are independently wealthy, asylum seekers can’t choose where to live, instead being sent to various parts of the country under a dispersal policy that often isolates them from any family or community networks they may have. The logic behind the system – which is the result of both Conservative and Labour governments – is that holding people in limbo while the state decides on their asylum cases is a way of reducing hostility. If asylum seekers can’t work, so goes the argument, there can be no accusations that they are stealing other people’s jobs. If people are scattered widely and kept in penury, then they are less easily accused of being a drain on the state. In reality, it has the opposite effect. Subsistence payments and precarious housing, however much these might compound the trauma of people who have fled war and persecution, are maliciously spun as freebies. Accommodation has long been placed in poorer parts of the country – partly for reasons of cost, but also because residents of wealthier areas have more power to make a fuss. (In 2020, civil servants apologised for their “error” in placing asylum seekers in the well-heeled Essex town of Witham – which just so happened to be the constituency of Priti Patel, home secretary at the time.)A system that treats its subjects as unwanted material to be tidied away is always likely to breed stigma. And the system has been getting worse. In 2012, the coalition privatised asylum accommodation, adding a chaotic market dynamic to the mix. Since 2020, the “emergency” use of hotels requisitioned by the Home Office has soared, initially as a pandemic measure but more recently because a growing backlog of asylum claims means the private contractors have run out of space. Hotels provide an easy target for the far right, and the way the Home Office has hired them out – at short notice and with little local consultation – creates new potential for resentment. (One Knowsley resident told the Guardian this week that beyond the immediate trigger for the protests, people were unhappy that the Home Office had taken over a hotel used by many locals for their weddings.)These processes were well under way before Suella Braverman took over, so what does it mean to have an even more hardline home secretary? She presents herself as the politician who can end the dysfunction at the Home Office and stop asylum being seen as a weak spot for the Tories. In her inaugural speech to civil servants, she signalled that there would be a more cordial relationship with staff than under her predecessor, speaking of their “wellbeing”. A source with knowledge of the Home Office tells me that anonymous briefings against civil servants, once commonplace, seem to have stopped for the moment. But the dysfunction continues. In November, a whistleblower claimed the department was hiring temporary, inexperienced staff from customer service jobs at McDonald’s and Tesco to make “life or death” decisions on asylum cases, in an effort to clear the backlog. Staff were so unhappy at the overcrowding, unsafe and unhygienic conditions at the Manston processing centre in Kent last autumn that one civil service trade union took the Home Office to court. Braverman’s “invasion” rhetoric is clearly a problem, but so too is her boss’s decision to make “stop the boats” one of his government’s five key pledges, even if he expresses himself more politely. Braverman has thrown the Home Office fully behind this goal: her decision last month to drop several measures recommended by the review into the Windrush scandal is one result. But a complete halt to Channel crossings is unlikely to be achieved – unless Sunak means that he merely wants people to go back to stowing away in lorries, as they largely did until 2020. As things stand, the government risks a repeat of Cameron’s net migration pledge, which inflamed public hostility towards immigration and created an incentive for yet more punitive policies to come. If that happens, the source suggested to me, then we are also likely to see a return of the “blame game” between ministers and civil servants. It is easy in these circumstances to feel as though the situation is hopeless, for lack of alternatives. Labour proposes to make the system more humane and efficient, but not to change its fundamental logic. Its leading MPs even seem to support a new Home Office scheme to electronically tag some asylum seekers. But wider reaching change is possible. The Scottish government’s “new Scots” strategy aims to undo some of the damage done by the asylum system run from Westminster by offering people support in accessing education, healthcare, job training and language skills, as well as making connections with people in the communities where they are housed, from the day they arrive. This is a direct challenge to the British state’s efforts at segregation. One reason the Scottish government has the confidence to do this is that Glasgow – which remains the UK’s largest asylum dispersal area – now boasts a local culture of resistance to overbearing immigration policy. It didn’t happen by accident. These things need to be built, often by ordinary people and activists who see through the cynical claim that migrants’ rights come at the expense of those of their neighbours.

All political projects carry within them the seeds of their own destruction. Contradictions, paradoxes and limitations are hardwired through the context and conditions of their creation. An endpoint is built in at birth. After Keir Starmer’s announcement that Jeremy Corbyn will not be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate at the next election – the leader’s latest shut-up-or-ship-out message to the party’s left – the lifeline of any incoming Labour or Labour-led government has been shortened, perhaps dramatically. ll political projects carry within them the seeds of their own destruction. Contradictions, paradoxes and limitations are hardwired through the context and conditions of their creation. An endpoint is built in at birth. After Keir Starmer’s announcement that Jeremy Corbyn will not be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate at the next election – the leader’s latest shut-up-or-ship-out message to the party’s left – the lifeline of any incoming Labour or Labour-led government has been shortened, perhaps dramatically. This is not about support for Corbynism or leftwing ideas per se. Instead, it is to argue that in an age of increasing complexity, chaos and confusion any political project must have an agility, nimbleness and fluidity that allows it to forge ever-changing intellectual and movement alliances. Pragmatic politics is now defined by openness – not the closure of debate he has called for with a legitimate, though some would say misguided, wing of his party. The argument Starmer is making seems to be this: shut up, let us get into government and we will pull the policy levers because we know what’s best for you. Of course, we know why he’s making it. Like Tony Blair, he believes the only route to office is by proving to the already powerful in the media and the City that Labour will not rock their boat. But unless their growth and greed boat is rocked, Labour is doomed to fail. The real question is how cleverly and effectively we rock that boat and over what time period? To do so requires the skills and the culture Starmer is turning his back on. In the 1950s, the psychiatrist and cyberneticist W Ross Ashby devised the Law of Requisite Variety, which stated that any body or organisation can only be effectively governed by a system that is equally complex. Simple organisations can be governed in simple ways, but a complex society such as ours demands complex systems of governance. Because we know what happens when any leader says “it’s my way or the highway”: they sign their own death warrant. The demand for obedience is the opposite of the feedback, challenge, creativity and innovation that successful modern politics demands. Withdrawing into a corner and defining anyone who fails to support you as an enemy just narrows the scope of your own vision and capacity to act. Most leaders end up on their own, few start there. The Italian political theorist Antonio Gramsci said there is always at least a grain of truth in your opponent’s argument. Starmer would be better listening to the left and synthesising any useful elements of its critique into a more robust and less brittle project. This is a politics of possibility because it is dynamic and not static: a politics based on the key ingredient of successful leadership – the ability to listen. In the 21st century, effective and enduring leadership is defined not by arrogant “get with it or get out of it” chest-beating, but by the careful curation of ideas, talent and networks: a new radical consensus, not dull conformity. To be fair to Starmer, his purge of the left is simply a more thorough and better organised version of what has gone before. The left under Corbyn promised deselections but never got round to them, while Blairism extinguished the left as much through ridicule as through the rulebook. Of course, the Conservative and now – minus Nicola Sturgeon – a possible SNP implosion could well see Starmer fall over the line first, but then what? Without roots in ideas and social energy, without the ability to renew and regenerate itself intellectually and culturally, his project will wither. The question is how fast and what will fill the vacuum?The idea that one small faction of one party can rule the chaotic waves of the 21st century is a non-starter. Neither Starmer nor anyone else is going to impose a better future on us; that can only be negotiated by all of us. For that to happen in our country, the skills and the tools have to be honed within the Labour party first. Neal Lawson is director of the cross-party campaign organisation Compass Long ago, in May 1960, an American U-2 spy plane took off from Pakistan to fly at high altitude across the Soviet Union as part of a mission to photograph key facilities and military sites on behalf of the CIA. The Russians saw it and shot it down. The pilot, Gary Powers, managed to descend by parachute and was arrested. In Washington, the Eisenhower administration lied about his mission, claiming the U-2 was a “weather plane” that had strayed off course after its pilot had “difficulties with his oxygen equipment” (sound familiar?).ong ago, in May 1960, an American U-2 spy plane took off from Pakistan to fly at high altitude across the Soviet Union as part of a mission to photograph key facilities and military sites on behalf of the CIA.

In Washington, the Eisenhower administration lied about his mission, claiming the U-2 was a “weather plane” that had strayed off course after its pilot had “difficulties with his oxygen equipment” (sound familiar?).The incident caused a temporary poisoning of US-Soviet relations as the Kremlin turned it into political theatre. Moscow subjected Powers to a highly publicised criminal trial and gave him a 10-year sentence. In the US, Powers was portrayed as an all-American clean-cut hero who neither smoked nor drank (which was not true). In spite of the mutual fury neither side was genuinely shocked, since it was accepted that spying was routine. The technology might change as improvements were made in information-gathering systems, but the practice of surveillance went back to time immemorial and could not be stopped. The analogy with the US downing of a Chinese high-altitude balloon that intruded into US airspace last week is clear. It too produced a hurricane of hypocritical outrage. The Republicans attacked Joe Biden for being weak and failing to protect US national security. They said he should have shot the intruding balloon down as soon as it was spotted. Fearful of being seen as too old to run for a second term, Biden ordered his secretary of state to delay a planned visit to Beijing. In a pathetic parody of the political row in Washington, the UK government promptly ordered a review of Britain’s security. Rishi Sunak forestalled any Labour charges of being weak on defence by announcing that RAF jets were on standby to shoot down any Chinese surveillance balloons that penetrated UK airspace. What about Chinese spy satellites? Are they also going to be taken out by doughty British pilots?The reality is that using technology to spy on other states’ military capabilities is as old as it is widespread. So is the use of covert tools to discover another government’s intentions. The methods are constantly being updated. Listening devices and phone-tapping have now been supplemented by cyber systems to hack emails and other internet messaging. An Israeli company, NSO Group, has – as well documented in the Guardian developed the Pegasus technology that can listen to conversations, read SMS texts, take screenshots and access people’s lists of contacts. It has sold the system to a range of authoritarian foreign governments that want to monitor their own citizens’ views and behaviour. Phone-tapping and cyber surveillance are not only done by governments to potential or actual enemies. Remember the row in 2013 that erupted during Barack Obama’s presidency after Edward Snowden revealed that the US National Security Agency had been listening to German chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone conversations for years. The Germans were almost as embarrassed as the Americans. Merkel angrily declared that “spying between friends just isn’t on” but an inquiry by the German federal prosecutor was quietly dropped. Let’s face it. Spying is a benefit. The more that countries know about a potential enemy’s defence systems the better it usually is. Starting hostilities is less likely if you have accurate and up-to-date information about what your army is up against (a lesson Vladimir Putin failed to learn before 24 February last year).Understanding another state’s or another leader’s intentions is even more important, whether this intelligence-gathering is performed by spies, diplomats and non-governmental political analysts or by what are politely called “technical means”. The crucial issue, which no amount of balloons or satellites can provide, is empathy. Put yourself in the other side’s shoes. Understand their history, culture and the economic and political pressures their leaders are under. There is no doubt that the relationship between the US and China is the leading global security challenge of at least the next 10 years. The two countries are rivals and competitors, but they are not enemies. Everything should be done by western countries not to slip into a mindset that treats China as hostile. Peace in Asia – and indeed the whole world – is too important to be hijacked by hysterical excitement over a roving balloon.

This was Facebook a few years ago, when plummeting engagement whipped the social media platform into a frenzy of desperate invitations and prompts. It’s Fresh Direct when you fill your basket with groceries and – I can’t recommend this enough, if you’re looking for the tiny high that comes from withholding – don’t check out, triggering a bunch of wheedling automated messages, begging you to come back. here’s a pathetic but satisfying thing that occurs when you stop using an online service you’re used to frequenting. This was Facebook a few years ago, when plummeting engagement whipped the social media platform into a frenzy of desperate invitations and prompts. It’s Fresh Direct when you fill your basket with groceries and – I can’t recommend this enough, if you’re looking for the tiny high that comes from withholding – don’t check out, triggering a bunch of wheedling automated messages, begging you to come back. This week, in my life, it’s Uber Eats. For the past couple of years I’ve ordered from them once a week and now I’ve stopped, causing the food delivery service to issue a flurry of semi-hysterical special offers. Each spam text, each begging notification, reminds me of the money I’m saving. If you like rejecting things (I like rejecting things) then this exercise will thrill you: rejection without the human cost of hurting someone’s feelings. The bigger picture, obviously, is a consumer trend away from the convenience-related services that surged during the pandemic. Companies that boomed and attracted millions in investment are starting to wither as our online habits change. In the US, instant delivery startups such as Buyk and Jokr, which briefly boomed in 2021, are declaring bankruptcy or pulling out of the US market. The meal-kit company Blue Apron has seen its share price plunge as food costs have risen and consumer interest in pricey convenience products has dwindled. The same goes for Stitch Fix, a service for clothing delivery that briefly boomed during the pandemic. And all of this in the context of mass lay-offs in tech at a time when those companies, seemingly, have nowhere left to expand. Though it may be bad for the economy, from the perspective of an individual trying to have a life that entails leaving the house, this trend is perhaps an encouraging sign. The same encouragement might be taken from the slowdown at Netflix; many of us are capped out after too many hours of watching TV. I’m not exactly out there every morning taking invigorating walks, but I am reading again, feeling more inclined to work rather than pass out on the sofa, and to seek out real-world rather than online experience. If habits inculcated during the pandemic were supposed to augur the future, as Derek Thompson wrote in the Atlantic last month, “the post-pandemic economy has been much weirder than most people anticipated”.For me, the weirdest of these impulses has been a desire to return to supermarket shopping. This is partly money-related; the downturn in fast-food delivery earnings is clearly linked to pinched household incomes. It’s also a health thing; many of us are still trying to reverse the damage done by all the junk food we ate during lockdown. But of all the habits adopted in the past couple of years, it seemed as if grocery delivery might be the obvious keeper. Post-pandemic, maybe no one wants a hulking great Peloton in their living room and the appeal of the third place – be it the gym or Starbucks – is enjoying an obvious bounce-back. But supermarket shopping, at least in New York where I live, has rarely been a pleasure. It has always been time-consuming, stressful and over-crowded, with in-store prices not much lower than what you pay for delivery. And yet, every Monday, I feel compelled to stand in line at Trader Joe’s, and stagger home carrying six bags of shopping. All I can put this desire down to is a combination of the small satisfaction that comes from making even minor economies in the present climate; and something less tangible to do with the joy, withheld during those two years of disruption, of going to a place and doing a thing. The expense of energy has itself become a virtue. Its inverse – ordering in; falling back on convenience and paying for it – seems not only to belong to a sadder period but, at this point, when one can go out, using one’s actual body, to feel like a moral failing. If it’s a hair shirt, perhaps it feels good simply in contrast to our pandemic wardrobe. Meanwhile, I suspect watching Uber Eats freak out will never get old. Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist Centrica, the company that owns British gas, has posted record profits of £3. 3bn for 2022, more than tripling its results in 2021. The company also announced it will pay a dividend to shareholders of more than £200m, and will spend a further £300m on share buybacks. With the cost of living crisis deepening, and following the prepayment meter scandal, the “monster” results have prompted outrage. That anger is more than justified. entrica, the company that owns British gas, has posted record profits of £3. 3bn for 2022, more than tripling its results in 2021.

With the cost of living crisis deepening, and following the prepayment meter scandal, the “monster” results have prompted outrage. That anger is more than justified. British Gas is, of course, hardly the only energy company announcing staggering windfalls. In recent weeks, Shell reported profits of over £32bn for 2022, while BP declared £23bn for the year. As with British Gas, historic profits have been translated into spectacular rewards for shareholders. BP, for instance, announced £11. 8bn of shareholder payouts, over 14 times as much as it invested in “low carbon” activities. This is how the energy crisis, climate emergency and inequality intersect and intensify. As household bills soar, the energy companies are using surging profits to increase shareholder payouts and double down on fossil fuel production. The profits of the energy sector are inseparable from soaring wholesale gas prices since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. However, looking beneath the bonnet of Centrica reveals three areas where exorbitant profits are being made: its commodity trading segment, where profits grew 20-fold to £1. 4bn; the UK’s woefully under-supplied gas storage sector, where profits more than quadrupled to £339m; and energy generation, where Centrica made a phenomenal 60% margin, thanks in large part to its stake in EDF UK’s nuclear fleet. Higher bills also feed their way into rising profits. Remarkably, Centrica’s UK electricity supply segment produced its largest profit since 2018, despite the squeeze from massively higher wholesale costs. While this did not contribute significantly to overall profits, the lesson is clear: even suppliers that are comfortably cushioned by colossal profits elsewhere in the business will not shield customers from the energy crisis. Given the public fury, how do the energy companies keep getting away with it? Why has such an obviously “broken” energy system not been reformed? The answer: despite appearances, it is not broken. By transferring and concentrating wealth upwards it is operating exactly as designed. This is because the rules that govern the modern corporation – and the financial markets that discipline them – force the energy companies to operate in only one way. Their fundamental goal is not the delivery of secure, affordable, clean energy. Instead, it is the maximisation of shareholder wealth by delivering rising share prices and generous payouts. This is the root of the issue: the purpose of our privatised, for-profit energy system does not align – by design – with the needs of people and planet. If the crisis is systemic, its resolution requires structural transformation. Given that external shocks are at the root of the energy sector’s enormous profits, a deepening and extension of the windfall tax is a clear and urgent necessity. However, this does not resolve the dynamic that is driving the crisis: the generation and supply of power by privately owned corporations legally required to maximise shareholder wealth. Given this, the most effective solution is the deployment of an older and more common tool used to manage shared infrastructure in the public interest: public ownership. Taking not just British Gas, but the UK’s wider renewable and nuclear energy assets, into public ownership can ensure the energy system is organised for the public good – and would eliminate value extraction for external shareholders. Moreover, it could be a spur to more rapid decarbonisation and the on-shoring of the green industrial supply chains of our post-carbon future. Today, it is British Gas. Last week, it was the oil and gas giants. The reality is that this pattern of extraction – of financial wealth from households to shareholders, and of fossil fossils from the Earth – will continue without systemic change. Given the context, of a deeply entangled social and energy crisis, ambitious reform is the surest path toward an energy future that works for us all. Mathew Lawrence is director of Common Wealth and co-author of Owning the Future with Adrienne Buller The shame of the Labour party – the Labour party! – being put into special measures by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for racism shocked most members to the core in 2020. To be released from that disgrace now is hardly a moment for celebration, after the EHRC’s original finding that Labour acted unlawfully in failing to rein in antisemitism under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. he shame of the Labour party – the Labour party! – being put into special measures by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for racism shocked most members to the core in 2020. To be released from that disgrace now is hardly a moment for celebration, after the EHRC’s original finding that Labour acted unlawfully in failing to rein in antisemitism under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. His refusal to accept the overall findings set Corbyn on an inevitable path out of the parliamentary Labour party. He maintains “The scale of the problem was dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media.” But a party can’t be a little bit racist: the damning findings had to be swallowed whole. Keir Starmer’s confirmation today that Corbyn cannot stand as a Labour candidate at the next general election is hardly surprising. Cleansing the party of antisemitism is deeply personal for Starmer, as his wife is Jewish and they keep Jewish festivals. But Corbyn’s obstinacy was convenient, too, his expulsion an opportunity to demonstrate Starmer’s mission to get a grip on the party. Rishi Sunak’s feeble jibes at Starmer for serving in Corbyn’s cabinet bounce off him now. Of course, as Starmer said yesterday today, it’s a job not quite done: when the Labour MP Kim Johnson got up at PMQs to call the Israeli government fascist, she had to apologise to the house promptly, under threat from the chief whip. Taking over the leadership during the Covid crisis, Starmer devoted his time to fixing the party internally as he slowly made progress with voters. Asked his mission, he declared it was “winning”. It has paid off handsomely as he soars in the polls. I am told that many reports from local meetings speak of the Corbynite influence fading, with some of his supporters leaving altogether or changing their mind as the party inches towards power. Starmer has been lucky in the total implosion of the Tories and lucky again with the resignation of Nicola Sturgeon: polling for all her likely successors is unimpressive, aiding Labour’s chances in Scotland. No opposition leader has ever scored as low in Ipsos’s polling as Corbyn’s -60 personal approval rating, with Michael Foot at -56, and Iain Duncan Smith and William Hague tied at -37. Corbyn benefited from his opponents’ disastrous campaign in 2017, though his personal rating trailed far behind both Theresa May’s and his own party’s popularity – Labour won 40% of votes to the Tories’ 42. 4%. Yet there are those who still see him as a saviour rather than a drag anchor: as the one who brought flocks of enthusiastic new members into the party, and prompted delighted chants of “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” at Glastonbury. He was betrayed by rightwingers in the party and brought down in 2019 by those who should have backed him, they say. The Guardian is often their chief villain. Whenever I write criticism of the government I am guaranteed Twitter and thread responses claiming that if only I, my colleagues and the paper had backed him, we wouldn’t be suffering this Tory era. A brief check in the archive would show that the only thing wrong with this analysis is that I, other columnists and the Guardian’s leader all urged voters to back Corbyn’s Labour party. How could we not, after a decade of brutal austerity, and given Boris Johnson’s unfitness for power? I backed just about every individual item in Labour’s 2019 manifesto: it was nothing like Michael Foot’s “longest suicide note in history”, which pledged to leave both the EU and Nato. Its obstacle was its implausible costings, with extra billions added during the campaign. But Labour’s worst problem was Corbyn himself, as voters feared his perceived lack of patriotism (prompted by, for example, his failure to sing the national anthem at a remembrance event) and told focus groups and pollsters they felt he was “not concerned about their issues” or “people like them”. Most voters never joined that misleading Glastonbury chorus. My own greatest anger with Corbyn him was over his refusal to campaign seriously against Brexit in the referendum. “Where is he?” I asked his advisers a couple of months before the vote. “He thinks the local elections more important,” was the unforgivable reply, when in truth he was a lexiter – a Bennite Brexiter. But because our monstrous election system offers only a binary choice, of course progressives of every hue had to back Labour against a nightmarish, sociopathic Tory leader. I never doubted that Corbyn would be a preferable prime minister to Johnson – the lowest of bars – but in 2019 he led Labour to its worst result since 1935. Now, Corbyn’s remaining believers cling to that last resort of all failed ideologues, the same refrain as the failing Brexiters’: we were betrayed. Corbyn seems likely to stand as an independent for Islington North, where Labour has an array of good would-be candidates. Groups within Labour such as Momentum may face a quandary, as they would automatically be expelled from the party if they campaigned for him against Labour. But in the present golden polling climate, it hardly matters who wins that one seat. What matters is that Labour has expunged the shame of the EHRC’s special measures. What matters, too, is that in its haste to escape the failure of Corbynism, Labour doesn’t overreach and purge anyone with anything original or interesting to say.

There is a serious, calm and thoughtful discussion to be had about the western democracies’ future security and economic relationship with China, and it is under way in Washington and European capitals. Judging by her confrontational, attention-seeking speech in Tokyo today, Britain’s disgraced former prime minister Liz Truss is not part of it. here is a serious, calm and thoughtful discussion to be had about the western democracies’ future security and economic relationship with China, and it is under way in Washington and European capitals. Judging by her confrontational, attention-seeking speech in Tokyo today, Britain’s disgraced former prime minister Liz Truss is not part of it. Truss, short of new ideas and insights, has defaulted to crowd-pleasing, hawkish positions that appear principally designed to facilitate a domestic political comeback at Rishi Sunak’s expense. A “totalitarian” China, she says, poses a global threat to the “free world”. Britain should help rally regional countries against Beijing by building a “Pacific defence alliance” and an “economic Nato”.Truss also calls on G7 states, which will meet in Hiroshima in May, to prepare to impose tough sanctions on China if it further escalates its military intimidation of Taiwan. The self-governing island should be admitted to international organisations from which it is currently excluded, she says – a red rag to Beijing. This stance echoed her previous, provocative call for Britain to supply weapons direct to Taipei. Truss is right to suggest relations with China are at a critical point, illustrated by the absurdly hyped flap in the US that accompanied the shooting down of a Chinese surveillance balloon. But her proposals, if actively pursued, could intensify east-west tensions, deepen the divide and boost Russia’s attempts to ally itself with Beijing – while doing little or nothing to enhance international security. Her Tokyo speech raises two broader questions: is Truss truly looking for workable ways to mitigate the aggressive posture of China’s president, Xi Jinping, or is she just posturing for hard-right, anti-China audiences in Westminster and Washington? Her position, including on the selective decoupling of economic relations, undercuts Sunak, who, like Joe Biden, has declined to classify China as a “threat”.Second, does Truss truly believe that Britain is still a global power with the political will, financial wherewithal and military firepower to intervene effectively in dangerous geopolitical crises thousands of miles from its shores? If so, she is truly delusional. Alone and adrift in a post-Brexit vacuum she helped create, Britain’s ability to influence world events is diminishing rapidly. The defence and security of Europe, of which it is a part, and not the Asia-Pacific region, is the UK’s primary strategic concern. Politically, she cannot admit that axiomatic fact. Empty threats do not make good foreign policy – and we have been here before. In her Mansion House speech last year, shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, Truss insisted Russian troops must be forced back to pre-2014 borders – meaning expelled from Crimea and all of Donbas. “We are going to keep going further and faster to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine,” she declared. You and whose army, Liz? Did she mean UK forces should launch a ground war against Russia? The Kremlin certainly thought so. Truss has hit repeat play in Tokyo, proving again that loose talk costs other people’s lives. There is no doubt Xi’s threats to subjugate Taiwan by force, his bullying of neighbours such as the Philippines, his colonisation of the South China Sea and his criminal treatment of the Uyghur and Tibetan peoples are shocking and alarming. But it is likewise clear, or should be, that Xi, despite his domestic problems, will not be deterred by a former colonial power with blood on its hands that poses no credible kinetic or economic challenge. The danger, instead, is that he may double down – with Taiwan in his gunsights. A US general recently predicted war within two years – and that was before the spy balloon went up. Yet what does calamity Liz do? She jumps in rhetorically with both feet, cliches flying. She can expect little support from the Biden administration. Likewise, Japan’s leaders may be privately appalled, though too polite to say so. Like Taiwan’s savvy president, Tsai Ing-wen, they prepare for the worst – and meantime try to manage the China relationship, not blow it up. Taking on China is not like taking on Russia. Vladimir Putin’s empire is built of straw. It will implode eventually, as happened to the Soviet Union in 1989-91. But China is too big to foil. Interdependence runs too deep, economic ties are too mutually valuable and shared challenges such as the climate emergency and nuclear proliferation are too pressing for the west to attempt to contain, let alone halt China’s rise. The western democracies have no sensible choice other than to continue to argue for their views and stand up for their values, issue by issue, while strengthening alliances, maintaining lines of communication and waiting for Beijing to modify its more objectionable behaviours, as Xi has recently started to do. Truss, with her siren calls, is digging the trenches of a second cold war. It’s a war Britain and the west cannot win – and should not fight. Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator and former Guardian foreign editor This week the UK government is holding a meeting to discuss generating more finance to conserve and restore nature. This is following its adoption of a global biodiversity framework in Montreal – the so-called biodiversity Cop15 – in December. Given that it is the destruction and loss of nature that drives the biodiversity crisis, and the framework aims to protect 30% of the Earth by 2030, this all seems like good news. his week the UK government is holding a meeting to discuss generating more finance to conserve and restore nature. This is following its adoption of a global biodiversity framework in Montreal – the so-called biodiversity Cop15 – in December. Given that it is the destruction and loss of nature that drives the biodiversity crisis, and the framework aims to protect 30% of the Earth by 2030, this all seems like good news. But as with the discussions in Canada over the framework itself, when it comes to the money, Indigenous peoples are being left out in the cold yet again. While the meeting will bring together private, public sector and philanthropy groups, we have no seat at the table. That’s a mistake. Addressing this crisis is not simply about getting the numbers right. The question of how these funds will be spent should be part of the agenda too, including who will spend them. All too often, states simply do not recognise the right to ownership over lands and territories of Indigenous peoples – and this has a huge impact on the conservation of natural resources. Worse, if communities are not part of the design of conservation projects, they have no input on the what, when and how of things such as reforestation efforts. And there’s ample evidence that Indigenous peoples are, in fact, the best custodians of biodiversity. Since the 1980s, in my region of Benguet in the northern Philippines, the government has been carrying out reforestation projects involving millions of dollars in grants or loans. In the early years, consultants recommended fast-growing species such as gmelina and eucalyptus to quickly reforest large areas, only to find they depleted water supplies. While the government contracted communities to plant seedlings, there was no budget for maintaining the young trees and many failed to thrive. And with the government claiming the land was public, some in the community felt little sense of responsibility to extinguish forest fires when they broke out. In contrast, there are areas in the Philippines’ Cordillera region that still have intact forest cover, where communities have been able to defend their land from mining and logging interests. Elsewhere in the country, the ancestral domains of the Palaw’an and the Mangyan peoples, on the islands of Palawan and Mindoro, have also remained intact. Their forests are teeming with native tree species, such as the almaciga, and unique animal species, found only in these locations, such as the tamaraw in Mindoro. Where communities were involved and in control of stewardship, nature was conserved better. Indigenous peoples are the rightful owners of many of the remaining spaces where biodiversity thrives, and as such we have much to contribute. Our efforts to protect nature should be supported. What’s more, Indigenous peoples have been serving humanity through their sustainable use of biodiversity for generations – pro bono and even, at times, at great peril to their lives. Indigenous peoples have asked for direct access to funding so we can fully exercise our role addressing the twin issues of biodiversity loss and the climate crisis. I myself have been part of efforts to lobby the body that allocates much of this funding, the Global Environment Facility, to be more responsive to our needs. But it consistently prioritises the needs of donors, not of those of us who are the custodians of biodiversity. It is no longer a question of just increasing the amounts available for biodiversity conservation: Indigenous peoples and local communities are demanding that we be part of all processes related to the use of these resources. Traditional funding mechanisms have been proved to be ineffective, costly and counterproductive; it is time to develop new mechanisms that put into practice the principles of equity. I want to reiterate that funding for biodiversity conservation should be made available to Indigenous peoples and local communities directly, to take into account their priorities and systems. There should be no discrimination over which ecosystems are to be supported – they are all valuable. Saving one without saving all will not resolve the biodiversity crisis. We have earned the right to be part of all discussions and processes in the implementation of the global biodiversity framework. To exclude us now is to waste the opportunities that the new nature deal has opened up. The crisis is real, and the solution lies in all of us working together.
