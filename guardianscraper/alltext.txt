Instead, he was stabbed to death in a park on his way home from a night out. It wasn’t an isolated incident. In the weeks surrounding his murder, gangs followed refugee children to and from school – one five-year-old boy was attacked with a baseball bat, according to an anti-racist campaign group – while hundreds of local residents held angry protests at the housing of asylum seekers in their deprived neighbourhood. This is exactly the kind of violent escalation that many must fear happening after the riot in Knowsley last Friday. In fact, Dag’s murder took place more than 20 years ago, in Glasgow in the summer of 2001. Then, as now, inflammatory political rhetoric played a part: in the early 2000s, Britain was in the grips of a tabloid-driven moral panic over asylum. Far-right groups were also trying to whip up anti-refugee sentiment, holding demonstrations in other parts of the country. A xenophobic backlash is always a risk when immigration becomes a fought-over political issue. Britain is not alone in that: in recent months Ireland has seen attempts by its tiny far-right scene, sensing an opportunity in tough economic times to stir up resentment of asylum seekers. But while politicians are rightly criticised when they pick up far-right talking points, there is another, underlying source of trouble here – the asylum system itself. For more than two decades, the British state has aimed to keep people seeking refuge walled off from the rest of society. They are banned from working while they wait for their claims to be heard and must subsist on meagre payments administered by the Home Office – £45 a week, or £9. 10 if placed in a hotel – in parallel to the regular benefits system. Unless they are independently wealthy, asylum seekers can’t choose where to live, instead being sent to various parts of the country under a dispersal policy that often isolates them from any family or community networks they may have. The logic behind the system – which is the result of both Conservative and Labour governments – is that holding people in limbo while the state decides on their asylum cases is a way of reducing hostility. If asylum seekers can’t work, so goes the argument, there can be no accusations that they are stealing other people’s jobs. If people are scattered widely and kept in penury, then they are less easily accused of being a drain on the state. In reality, it has the opposite effect. Subsistence payments and precarious housing, however much these might compound the trauma of people who have fled war and persecution, are maliciously spun as freebies. Accommodation has long been placed in poorer parts of the country – partly for reasons of cost, but also because residents of wealthier areas have more power to make a fuss. (In 2020, civil servants apologised for their “error” in placing asylum seekers in the well-heeled Essex town of Witham – which just so happened to be the constituency of Priti Patel, home secretary at the time.)A system that treats its subjects as unwanted material to be tidied away is always likely to breed stigma. And the system has been getting worse. In 2012, the coalition privatised asylum accommodation, adding a chaotic market dynamic to the mix. Since 2020, the “emergency” use of hotels requisitioned by the Home Office has soared, initially as a pandemic measure but more recently because a growing backlog of asylum claims means the private contractors have run out of space. Hotels provide an easy target for the far right, and the way the Home Office has hired them out – at short notice and with little local consultation – creates new potential for resentment. (One Knowsley resident told the Guardian this week that beyond the immediate trigger for the protests, people were unhappy that the Home Office had taken over a hotel used by many locals for their weddings.)These processes were well under way before Suella Braverman took over, so what does it mean to have an even more hardline home secretary? She presents herself as the politician who can end the dysfunction at the Home Office and stop asylum being seen as a weak spot for the Tories. In her inaugural speech to civil servants, she signalled that there would be a more cordial relationship with staff than under her predecessor, speaking of their “wellbeing”. A source with knowledge of the Home Office tells me that anonymous briefings against civil servants, once commonplace, seem to have stopped for the moment. But the dysfunction continues. In November, a whistleblower claimed the department was hiring temporary, inexperienced staff from customer service jobs at McDonald’s and Tesco to make “life or death” decisions on asylum cases, in an effort to clear the backlog. Staff were so unhappy at the overcrowding, unsafe and unhygienic conditions at the Manston processing centre in Kent last autumn that one civil service trade union took the Home Office to court. Braverman’s “invasion” rhetoric is clearly a problem, but so too is her boss’s decision to make “stop the boats” one of his government’s five key pledges, even if he expresses himself more politely. Braverman has thrown the Home Office fully behind this goal: her decision last month to drop several measures recommended by the review into the Windrush scandal is one result. But a complete halt to Channel crossings is unlikely to be achieved – unless Sunak means that he merely wants people to go back to stowing away in lorries, as they largely did until 2020. As things stand, the government risks a repeat of Cameron’s net migration pledge, which inflamed public hostility towards immigration and created an incentive for yet more punitive policies to come. If that happens, the source suggested to me, then we are also likely to see a return of the “blame game” between ministers and civil servants. It is easy in these circumstances to feel as though the situation is hopeless, for lack of alternatives. Labour proposes to make the system more humane and efficient, but not to change its fundamental logic. Its leading MPs even seem to support a new Home Office scheme to electronically tag some asylum seekers. But wider reaching change is possible. The Scottish government’s “new Scots” strategy aims to undo some of the damage done by the asylum system run from Westminster by offering people support in accessing education, healthcare, job training and language skills, as well as making connections with people in the communities where they are housed, from the day they arrive. This is a direct challenge to the British state’s efforts at segregation. One reason the Scottish government has the confidence to do this is that Glasgow – which remains the UK’s largest asylum dispersal area – now boasts a local culture of resistance to overbearing immigration policy. It didn’t happen by accident. These things need to be built, often by ordinary people and activists who see through the cynical claim that migrants’ rights come at the expense of those of their neighbours.

Sometimes they appear in the form of an orb of light, high in the sky, that seems to pass through solid objects such as trees and buildings.

Sometimes it’s a strange mist that descends out of nowhere. In an increasing number of cases, an object that can’t be seen with the naked eye shows up clearly in a photographic image. These are examples of UFOs – literally, unidentified flying objects – that are spotted in UK skies every day. In the wake of the US shooting down a suspected Chinese spy balloon, plus three other objects it has yet to identify, experts say there are going to be a lot more of these kinds of sightings. As a UFO researcher, I treat these things with scepticism and scientific rigour, but part of me hopes they will never be fully explained. As the head of national investigations for the British UFO Research Association (Bufora), I’m one of a team of people who investigate such sightings, which are sent to us by the public at a rate of hundreds a year. Often they come as grainy mobile phone footage taken at dusk or from a moving car, but we also require witnesses to fill in a detailed form explaining what they saw, heard, felt and even smelled at the time of the event. We promise to treat sightings confidentially, objectively and with scientific rigour. In 98% of cases, we find they have a simple explanation. Typically, when we receive a report at Bufora, I take a look and pass it on to our photographic analyst, Mark Easen. Objects most commonly turn out to be drones, aircraft (sometimes military aircraft), satellites, meteors, balloons, lanterns or birds. When Elon Musk’s SpaceX first launched its Starlink satellites in 2019, we were inundated with sightings of small pinpricks of light moving steadily across the night sky, sometimes 50 or 100 at a time. By finding out where witnesses are at the time and what airports, military bases or other facilities are nearby, we can usually identify the objects they’ve observed. It’s important to know what they’ve seen with the naked eye, because often a UFO will turn out to be a speck of dust on the camera lens, a tiny insect flying into shot or the reflection of a seatbelt buckle in a car window. First, we rule out the obvious. If it looks like a plane and flies like a plane, it’s usually a plane. Reports follow patterns and trends that reflect the changing media landscape. In our not-too-distant past, unexplainable phenomena tended to be reported as fairies or goblins – things people saw in the folklore and mythology of the day. Now, sci-fi books and films affect the way people interpret what they have seen. There’s a particular type of sighting that we call high strangeness sightings (HSS), when someone feels they have been up close and personal with something of unknown origin – and during the 1990s, when The X-Files was hugely influential, as many as 8% of sightings reported to us were HSS. They’re usually rare, but I saw them increase again during lockdown. People were scared, and understandably so. I became interested in space when I lived in the US in the 1970s and early 80s, where my dad was an aeronautical engineer for Nasa. But I’ve always been interested in extraordinary human experiences – things outside the boundaries of what we understand. The UFO subject embraces a huge and diverse landscape: science, religion, folklore and myth, the paranormal, neuroscience and philosophy. I’ve learned a lot about the way memory works: once you lay down an experience into long-term memory, each time you access that memory it is slightly edited. You add to it things you’ve seen, conversations you’ve had, a TV programme you saw. I never think people are foolish when they report a UFO; I’m just fascinated by the ways we interpret reality. I’m often asked what I believe about extraterrestrial life, and whether it will ever make contact. After all, about 2% of the UFOs we hear about can’t be identified – yet. In all the years I’ve spent looking at the evidence, I have never seen any definitive proof that a UFO has been extraterrestrial in origin, but I don’t close my mind to the possibility. I’m sceptical – to do this work properly I have to be. But, as JBS Haldane wrote: “It is my suspicion that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.”Personally, I think there will be a rational explanation for the objects that have been shot down by the US military recently. But there are still mysteries, and I think there always will be. I wonder what narratives humans will invent to explain the sightings of tomorrow, and what science fiction will come up with next. Will science and expert analysis be able to explain all of these things, eventually? I suspect not. I hope not.

It wasn’t that the first minister’s departure was unexpected. Though the precise timing was a shock, she has been visibly flagging for months, and her popularity has been waning even among SNP diehards. “She’s lost the room,” one loyalist told me recently.

When Jacinda Ardern – a politician Sturgeon greatly admires – stepped down as the prime minister of New Zealand with the words: “We give all that we can for as long as we can. And then it’s time,” I imagined Sturgeon thinking: “That’s the way to do it.”Nor am I blind to the chequered nature of the first minister’s legacy. It has been disappointing to watch a woman who came to power with such noble aspirations fail to deliver on a succession of pledges, such as closing the educational attainment gap, and become mired in a succession of controversies, such as the ferry fiasco and the “missing” £600,000 of SNP funds. Yet her speech – and the poise with which she delivered it – brought back all that was good about her leadership: the almost Calvinist sense of duty, the relatability, the humility. These are qualities absent in the five UK prime ministers who have been in office as she attempted to steer her ship through the choppy waters that their greed and populism created. Sturgeon has her own character flaws. Her cautious nature has had a dampening effect on her radicalism, and her reluctance to listen to anyone outside her inner circle led to errors of judgment on the “named person” legislation, which was later found to breach children’s right to privacy, and on the gender recognition reform bill, which Rishi Sunak blocked in a historic challenge to Scottish devolution. Still, if Boris Johnson, Liz Truss or Sunak had possessed a fraction of Sturgeon’s integrity, there would have been no Brexit, no support for bankers’ bonuses and no hint of tax avoidance. And if they had acknowledged the SNP’s overwhelming mandate for a second independence referendum, she would not now be facing criticism for failing to secure one. Furthermore, while Sturgeon’s policies may not have been ambitious enough for those on the left of the SNP, Scotland’s tax system is the most progressive in the UK, and the Conservatives’ welfare reforms are being mitigated by the child payment – £25 per child per week for low-income families. Sturgeon made enemies on both sides of the constitutional divide. Sometimes it felt like she couldn’t win. But the sight of her, eloquent and self-reflective at the podium brought back her finest hour: guiding Scotland through the pandemic. There were mistakes there, too, of course, most notably the release of untested hospital patients into care homes. But her messaging was always clear and direct, and you never doubted she cared or that she was giving her all. You could no more imagine Sturgeon socialising while other people mourned alone than you could imagine Johnson stacking chairs at the end of a political meeting (something Sturgeon was wont to do even as first minister). Or resigning gracefully in the interests of his party and his country. Her speech was also a reminder of how she transformed the landscape. When I returned to Scotland from England in 1996, politics and journalism was male-dominated, with female voices pushed to the margins. Sturgeon changed all that, not merely by being a woman at the helm (after all, there have been two female prime ministers during her time in power), but by actively promoting gender equality. Her government’s handling of the initial allegations against Alex Salmond, and the inquiry that followed, almost proved her undoing. But the impulse to change the sexual harassment complaints process came from a place of principle; and she stuck to those principles despite the outpouring of vitriol and misogyny they unleashed. Though Sturgeon insists the fallout from the GRR bill was not the catalyst for her departure, the accusation that she has squandered her right to be considered a feminist must be painful. The timing of her resignation appears to have more to do with the forthcoming conference on “election-based options” designed to force the UK government into negotiations on independence. Sturgeon knows her preferred option – turning the general election into a de facto referendum – is divisive. “And I cannot in good conscience ask the party to choose an option based on my judgment, whilst not being convinced that I would be there as leader to see it through,” she explained. “Conscience”: there’s a concept that’s been in short supply these last 10 years. I admire Sturgeon for not clinging too desperately to her dream of personally delivering independence. It must be tough to give up something that has consumed so much of your life – although it may be easier to cede power if you have not desired it for its own sake, but as a means of securing an ideal that transcends your own ego. I admire her, too, for not believing she is indispensable; for having faith in the next generation of SNP politicians. My service station sadness was part ruefulness for what might have been, part fear there was no one else capable of filling her shoes. It’s impossible to conceive of any of the touted contenders – Kate Forbes, Keith Brown, Neil Gray – filling stadiums full of selfie-seeking fans. But while Sturgeon’s competence was established before she became first minister, her popularity was a product of timing; she rode into town on a post-referendum high. Whoever succeeds her will have to make their own luck, to rethink the party’s entire strategy and approach. That may be no bad thing.

The political vultures have been circling Nicola Sturgeon for several weeks now. But her resignation as first minister and leader of the SNP still comes as a lightning bolt from a not especially threatening Scottish political sky.

But her resignation as first minister and leader of the SNP still comes as a lightning bolt from a not especially threatening Scottish political sky. It is certain to trigger the biggest convulsion in Scottish politics since the independence referendum of 2014, and its implications will be felt across the electoral and constitutional politics of the whole UK too. Sturgeon’s resignation statement at Bute House today showed why she will be such a formidable act to follow, and also why it is time for her to go. She had much to say, about Scotland, independence, Covid and political life, which was as eloquently done as ever. But her speech, perhaps like her leadership, went on too long. Even as she spoke, you could sense that the political world was cruelly turning to consider the post-Sturgeon era. It has been a commonplace among those who track Scottish politics that Sturgeon has been in what one columnist called her late imperial phase for many months. She had begun to lose her touch – and hence her hold – especially when compared with her mother-of-the-nation mastery during Covid. Even within the ranks of her Scottish National party, the most self-disciplined and tongue-holding political force in these islands outside Sinn Féin, criticisms and disagreements were being voiced. Sturgeon’s departure emerges from a constellation of proximate causes. Her handling of Scotland’s new gender recognition laws – unpopular with the majority of Scots – has been uncharacteristically heavy footed. Her strategy on independence – still the central divide in Scottish politics – has been heading into a constitutional cul-de-sac. Her domestic record as first minister has come under unusually intense and scathing challenge. Her performances in the Holyrood parliament and in her recent press conferences have been second rate, especially from a political leader who was once such an accomplished public performer. In the end, though, she is surely also going for the reason that she tried to put at the centre of her resignation speech. She has been SNP leader and first minister for eight years now, since succeeding Alex Salmond. She was Salmond’s deputy for nearly eight years before that. There is no ideal number of years for a leader to serve, but Sturgeon’s 16 years – like those of Angela Merkel – are surely too much. As Jacinda Ardern put it, she simply doesn’t have enough left in the tank. Sturgeon’s departure triggers a leadership contest between contenders who possess only a fraction of her name and brand recognition. The contest will not be like 2014, when Sturgeon was the self-evident SNP leader in waiting. Sturgeon is said to believe that Kate Forbes, the Scottish finance secretary, possesses, as Napoleon once put it, a marshal’s baton in her knapsack. Forbes is talented but she is also relatively untested. She also comes from a much less liberal progressive background than either Sturgeon or Salmond. Her views on abortion and gender recognition are not Sturgeon’s. It would be ironic if these views equipped Forbes to reach across the political divide in the way that Sturgeon said today she herself could no longer do. In the short run, Sturgeon’s successor must navigate what will now be a much less predictable SNP special conference next month on independence strategy. Sturgeon made a point of saying in her resignation speech that her departure would free the SNP to choose its path. But this will not be easy or necessarily successful. The SNP stands or falls on independence. In the medium term, Sturgeon’s departure robs the SNP of its greatest individual electoral asset. It would be outrageous to claim that the SNP has been a one-woman band, any more than it was a one-man band under Salmond. But the SNP always put Sturgeon front and centre of all its electoral campaigns, and without her there will not be the same allure and confidence. For that reason, today was a very good day for Scottish Labour and for Keir Starmer, who will see their general election chances boosted. In the long run, though, the big question posed by Sturgeon’s resignation is whether this is the watershed moment for the independence cause that unionists quietly crave and nationalists, if they are frank, still fear. Does her departure mean, and reflect the fact, that the nationalist tide has passed its high point? Is the United Kingdom a little more secure tonight with Sturgeon’s going than it was when she was in the ascendancy? Many will think that the answer is yes. But many have been wrong about this very subject before. Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist Long ago, in May 1960, an American U-2 spy plane took off from Pakistan to fly at high altitude across the Soviet Union as part of a mission to photograph key facilities and military sites on behalf of the CIA. The Russians saw it and shot it down. The pilot, Gary Powers, managed to descend by parachute and was arrested. In Washington, the Eisenhower administration lied about his mission, claiming the U-2 was a “weather plane” that had strayed off course after its pilot had “difficulties with his oxygen equipment” (sound familiar?).ong ago, in May 1960, an American U-2 spy plane took off from Pakistan to fly at high altitude across the Soviet Union as part of a mission to photograph key facilities and military sites on behalf of the CIA.

In Washington, the Eisenhower administration lied about his mission, claiming the U-2 was a “weather plane” that had strayed off course after its pilot had “difficulties with his oxygen equipment” (sound familiar?).The incident caused a temporary poisoning of US-Soviet relations as the Kremlin turned it into political theatre. Moscow subjected Powers to a highly publicised criminal trial and gave him a 10-year sentence. In the US, Powers was portrayed as an all-American clean-cut hero who neither smoked nor drank (which was not true). In spite of the mutual fury neither side was genuinely shocked, since it was accepted that spying was routine. The technology might change as improvements were made in information-gathering systems, but the practice of surveillance went back to time immemorial and could not be stopped. The analogy with the US downing of a Chinese high-altitude balloon that intruded into US airspace last week is clear. It too produced a hurricane of hypocritical outrage. The Republicans attacked Joe Biden for being weak and failing to protect US national security. They said he should have shot the intruding balloon down as soon as it was spotted. Fearful of being seen as too old to run for a second term, Biden ordered his secretary of state to delay a planned visit to Beijing. In a pathetic parody of the political row in Washington, the UK government promptly ordered a review of Britain’s security. Rishi Sunak forestalled any Labour charges of being weak on defence by announcing that RAF jets were on standby to shoot down any Chinese surveillance balloons that penetrated UK airspace. What about Chinese spy satellites? Are they also going to be taken out by doughty British pilots?The reality is that using technology to spy on other states’ military capabilities is as old as it is widespread. So is the use of covert tools to discover another government’s intentions. The methods are constantly being updated. Listening devices and phone-tapping have now been supplemented by cyber systems to hack emails and other internet messaging. An Israeli company, NSO Group, has – as well documented in the Guardian developed the Pegasus technology that can listen to conversations, read SMS texts, take screenshots and access people’s lists of contacts. It has sold the system to a range of authoritarian foreign governments that want to monitor their own citizens’ views and behaviour. Phone-tapping and cyber surveillance are not only done by governments to potential or actual enemies. Remember the row in 2013 that erupted during Barack Obama’s presidency after Edward Snowden revealed that the US National Security Agency had been listening to German chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone conversations for years. The Germans were almost as embarrassed as the Americans. Merkel angrily declared that “spying between friends just isn’t on” but an inquiry by the German federal prosecutor was quietly dropped. Let’s face it. Spying is a benefit. The more that countries know about a potential enemy’s defence systems the better it usually is. Starting hostilities is less likely if you have accurate and up-to-date information about what your army is up against (a lesson Vladimir Putin failed to learn before 24 February last year).Understanding another state’s or another leader’s intentions is even more important, whether this intelligence-gathering is performed by spies, diplomats and non-governmental political analysts or by what are politely called “technical means”. The crucial issue, which no amount of balloons or satellites can provide, is empathy. Put yourself in the other side’s shoes. Understand their history, culture and the economic and political pressures their leaders are under. There is no doubt that the relationship between the US and China is the leading global security challenge of at least the next 10 years. The two countries are rivals and competitors, but they are not enemies. Everything should be done by western countries not to slip into a mindset that treats China as hostile. Peace in Asia – and indeed the whole world – is too important to be hijacked by hysterical excitement over a roving balloon.

After Keir Starmer’s announcement that Jeremy Corbyn will not be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate at the next election – the leader’s latest shut-up-or-ship-out message to the party’s left – the lifeline of any incoming Labour or Labour-led government has been shortened, perhaps dramatically. ll political projects carry within them the seeds of their own destruction. Contradictions, paradoxes and limitations are hardwired through the context and conditions of their creation. An endpoint is built in at birth. After Keir Starmer’s announcement that Jeremy Corbyn will not be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate at the next election – the leader’s latest shut-up-or-ship-out message to the party’s left – the lifeline of any incoming Labour or Labour-led government has been shortened, perhaps dramatically. This is not about support for Corbynism or leftwing ideas per se. Instead, it is to argue that in an age of increasing complexity, chaos and confusion any political project must have an agility, nimbleness and fluidity that allows it to forge ever-changing intellectual and movement alliances. Pragmatic politics is now defined by openness – not the closure of debate he has called for with a legitimate, though some would say misguided, wing of his party. The argument Starmer is making seems to be this: shut up, let us get into government and we will pull the policy levers because we know what’s best for you. Of course, we know why he’s making it. Like Tony Blair, he believes the only route to office is by proving to the already powerful in the media and the City that Labour will not rock their boat. But unless their growth and greed boat is rocked, Labour is doomed to fail. The real question is how cleverly and effectively we rock that boat and over what time period? To do so requires the skills and the culture Starmer is turning his back on. In the 1950s, the psychiatrist and cyberneticist W Ross Ashby devised the Law of Requisite Variety, which stated that any body or organisation can only be effectively governed by a system that is equally complex. Simple organisations can be governed in simple ways, but a complex society such as ours demands complex systems of governance. Because we know what happens when any leader says “it’s my way or the highway”: they sign their own death warrant. The demand for obedience is the opposite of the feedback, challenge, creativity and innovation that successful modern politics demands. Withdrawing into a corner and defining anyone who fails to support you as an enemy just narrows the scope of your own vision and capacity to act. Most leaders end up on their own, few start there. The Italian political theorist Antonio Gramsci said there is always at least a grain of truth in your opponent’s argument. Starmer would be better listening to the left and synthesising any useful elements of its critique into a more robust and less brittle project. This is a politics of possibility because it is dynamic and not static: a politics based on the key ingredient of successful leadership – the ability to listen. In the 21st century, effective and enduring leadership is defined not by arrogant “get with it or get out of it” chest-beating, but by the careful curation of ideas, talent and networks: a new radical consensus, not dull conformity. To be fair to Starmer, his purge of the left is simply a more thorough and better organised version of what has gone before. The left under Corbyn promised deselections but never got round to them, while Blairism extinguished the left as much through ridicule as through the rulebook. Of course, the Conservative and now – minus Nicola Sturgeon – a possible SNP implosion could well see Starmer fall over the line first, but then what? Without roots in ideas and social energy, without the ability to renew and regenerate itself intellectually and culturally, his project will wither. The question is how fast and what will fill the vacuum?The idea that one small faction of one party can rule the chaotic waves of the 21st century is a non-starter. Neither Starmer nor anyone else is going to impose a better future on us; that can only be negotiated by all of us. For that to happen in our country, the skills and the tools have to be honed within the Labour party first. Neal Lawson is director of the cross-party campaign organisation Compass An independent Scotland has not been hindered by Nicola Sturgeon’s departure; it could well be advanced by it. Her eight years as first minister have been remarkable, but failed to bring statehood closer to reality. The question is whether her intransigence postponed it. n independent Scotland has not been hindered by Nicola Sturgeon’s departure; it could well be advanced by it. Her eight years as first minister have been remarkable, but failed to bring statehood closer to reality. The question is whether her intransigence postponed it. Sturgeon made a strategic error after her predecessor Alex Salmond lost the 2014 independence referendum. She assumed her charisma could swiftly erode the 55% turnout for continued union with England and secure a victorious rerun of the poll. Despite her electoral successes, she never seriously dented that majority. All Sturgeon could do was plunge an ever more visceral anti-Englishness into courtroom battles with London that she was never likely to win. Salmond had in 2014 foolishly rejected David Cameron’s offer of a second referendum option for so-called “devo max”, a radically enhanced Scottish autonomy. This would certainly have passed, with polls indicating 66% support among Scottish voters. While devo max was a constitutional can of worms, it could not have been wished away. It should have begun a drastic restructuring of the Scottish economy away from dependence on – and therefore control from – London. At very least it would have put serious autonomy within the realm of plausibility. The question now is how far could a new SNP leader take such a move towards greater autonomy forward, possibly aided by sensible and open-minded leaders of the Labour and Tory parties. To Sturgeon, the issue bordered on the theological. As with Salmond, it was freedom or bust, independence or serfdom. They wanted their own currency, their own debt, a hard border with England, membership of the EU and no UK weapons on Scottish soil. This was fantasy enough but at no point did it engage in the elephant in the independence room – economics. Gazing across the Irish Sea, we can all study Ireland’s experience since independence a century ago, when under British rule it was among the poorest nations in Europe. Depending on definition, it is today one of the most prosperous. But it took Dublin 50 years of austerity and pain – including a meagre welfare state – to get there. Not until the 1980s did it achieve such key indicators of growth as a net inflow of investment, population and talent, and “Celtic tiger” status. There is no tartan tiger. Sturgeon’s leadership enabled the Scots to have their cake and eat it. Her fierce nationalism gave voters emotional satisfaction. She ran hospitals, schools, trains, law and order, while Covid gave Scotland a degree of administrative discretion. Limited scope to raise top income taxes allowed a generous family support package and free student tuition. But this did not deliver the Scottish people conspicuously better services, and it depended heavily on an annual subsidy from London. Scotland’s budget deficit in 2020-21 of 22% of GDP was among the largest of any nation in the western world, though surging oil and gas revenues have recently cut it back. Similarly sized Denmark runs a surplus of 4%. The annual UK government grant to Scotland announced last October was a record £41bn. This is money a Scottish treasury would have to find on its own, which is why Scotland’s standard of living needs union into the foreseeable future. As Ireland shows, there is a path out of dependency, but it is neither easy nor swift. Federal constitutions in Spain, Switzerland and Germany indicate that the key to autonomy lies in fiscal freedom, in the capacity to grow, earn and spend, independent of policies ordained by a central government. The Basques and the Swiss cantons enjoy fiscal discretions unthinkable to the British Treasury – but the key lies in fiscal self-sufficiency. Advocates of independence persistently fail to confront this. There is no reason why Scotland cannot approach the prosperity of Ireland or Scandinavia. Decades of reliance on the most centralist political economy in Europe – that of the UK – have crippled Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Devo max might aim to embrace some of Ireland’s libertarian taxes along with Norway’s links to the EU’s single market. It might conceivably join with Northern Ireland in its revitalised Brexit protocol, ingeniously returning to the EU’s trading regime and yet free to trade with England. A digital border would be complicated, as Ireland is showing, but it would honour the clear vote of a majority of Scots against Brexit. The concept of devo max – so-called “full fiscal autonomy” or “radical federalism” – is now debated by many on the fringes of the independence debate, in Wales as well as Scotland. The effort is to move forward from political confrontation. Federalism covers a spectrum of options but its purpose is to offer Scotland a freer hand to raise and spend public money, while offering London relief from a heavy burden in Scotland. It would be what Ireland was denied by England in the 19th century, true home rule under the crown. Had it been granted, the old United Kingdom might still be one. As for Sturgeon’s successor, such an outcome could deliver a new Scotland mercifully at peace with London. Or it could prepare a path to full independence if that were, in my view sadly, to be Scotland’s eventual choice. Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist You might imagine that nothing could prevent a Labour victory at the next election. The Conservatives could scarcely have done more to alienate voters and destroy public trust. Everyone knows that in this ridiculous first-past-the-post system, the only party in a position to replace them is Labour. Many will vote accordingly. ou might imagine that nothing could prevent a Labour victory at the next election. The Conservatives could scarcely have done more to alienate voters and destroy public trust. Everyone knows that in this ridiculous first-past-the-post system, the only party in a position to replace them is Labour. Many will vote accordingly. But there is one major obstacle: the Labour party. It seems determined to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. How? By pursuing a civil lawsuit alleging breach of contract against five close associates of Jeremy Corbyn, whom it accuses of leaking a highly sensitive report. The report, 860 pages long, was written to be submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which was conducting an inquiry into allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party. It included WhatsApp messages between staff members in Labour headquarters, in some cases containing grotesquely sexist and racist comments. It alleged sabotage by a faction in Labour party HQ opposed to Corbyn’s leadership, and claimed that this obstructionism prevented complaints from being swiftly addressed. Following legal advice, the report was not submitted to the EHRC. It was leaked to the press in April 2020. I think the case against the five alleged leakers, among whom is Seumas Milne, Corbyn’s former executive director of strategy and communications – and before that a Guardian columnist and comment editor – looks very weak. The Information Commissioner’s Office investigated three of them and decided there was “insufficient evidence” to prosecute. Nor were external investigators hired by the Labour party able to identify the leakers. Sources told the BBC that up to 15 other people may have had access to the report. The impact of pursuing this case could be massive. It is likely to come to court early next year, coinciding with an election campaign. The horrendous content of some of the messages leaked in the files, and the civil war within the party that the suit may reignite, could scarcely be greater gifts to the Conservatives. If the Labour party loses, it could be liable for an estimated £3-4m in costs – a figure Labour denies – perhaps sufficient to bankrupt the party. The leaked report contains names and personal details that were not redacted, breaching confidentiality. But it also provides useful insights into Labour party operations during the Corbyn years. It reveals how an utter collapse in effective management was caused by factional warfare and rendered the party almost incapable of taking decisive action. Plenty of denialists, often using the hashtag #ItWasAScam, have sought to use the report to dismiss the issue of antisemitism in the party. It offers them no such comfort. Right at the start, the report notes: “This report thoroughly disproves any suggestion that antisemitism is not a problem in the party, or that it is all a ‘smear’ or a ‘witch-hunt’.” As I know to my cost, acknowledging the reality of antisemitism in Labour triggers a storm of abuse. But denying it is stupid and disgraceful. The leak has led to several important outcomes. One of them is the Forde report, commissioned by Labour to investigate the veracity of the report’s allegations and the party’s culture and practices. It found that while both sides treated antisemitism “as a factional weapon”, and while there were “structural problems” with the disciplinary system that made it unfit for purpose, there was not clear and convincing evidence of a systematic attempt by the leadership to undermine disciplinary action. It concluded that the suspension of existing members and the exclusion of applicants by the Labour party’s governance and legal unit – described as “Trot hunting” in the WhatsApp messages – was “factionally slanted” by removing ballots from people “who would otherwise have voted for Jeremy Corbyn”. This embedded the “extremely damaging” conviction among parts of the membership that the disciplinary system was rigged against them. The dysfunction these problems caused was exacerbated by the utter chaos within the Corbyn team. While Labour pursues its case against the alleged leakers, it has done little to act upon the Forde report’s recommendations, to ensure that there can be no repetition of the misogyny, racism and factional discrimination revealed by the leaked report. In other words, Keir Starmer’s party is pursuing, beyond all apparent reason, the alleged leakers, but not the issues the leak exposed. Another outcome of the leak is a series on Al Jazeera called The Labour Files. Al Jazeera has had its own antisemitism scandals, including a video denying the Holocaust. Nevertheless, The Labour Files produced strong evidence that some of the claims made about Corbyn and his team in the media were wrong. Perhaps the most decisive blow to Corbyn’s leadership was the BBC Panorama programme Is Labour Antisemitic? It interviewed a former Labour official who, it claimed, was confronted in a disciplinary hearing “by the very antisemitism he’d been investigating”. He alleged that the woman he was questioning asked him: “Where are you from?… Are you from Israel?” But the two women in the meeting, both of whom are Jewish, had recorded the conversation with his permission. Backed by their recording, whose veracity no one seems to have disputed, they say it shows that she said something entirely different: “What branch are you in?” – meaning what branch of the party. And that when he told her he didn’t think that was relevant, she said simply: “Oh, OK.”Another Panorama contributor was a Labour party member called Izzy Lenga. Her edited interview stated the following. “I joined the Labour party in 2015. The antisemitic abuse I received was what I was subjected to every single day. Telling me Hitler was right, telling me Hitler did not go far enough.” In December 2022, after this account was challenged by The Labour Files, the BBC published a clarification. It shows that Lenga actually said: “When I was a student … being quite a high-profile Jewish woman student, I was subjected to quite a lot of like nasty vitriol and abuse … The antisemitic abuse I received … was what I was subjected to every single day … Predictably a lot of it came from the far right … neo-Nazi abuse … telling me Hitler was right, telling me Hitler did not go far enough.” She said she had received similar abuse “from the far left”.She then said: “In Labour party meetings … we’ve seen people engage in Holocaust denial … and that’s terrifying for Jewish members … It absolutely breaks my heart to say but I do not think the Labour party is a safe space for Jewish people any more.” So her view of the party was clear, but what she said had not been accurately reported throughout. Why, when Labour needs to focus all its fire on the Tories, to rebuild trust and present a united front to the electorate, is it exposing its greatest vulnerability once more? When I asked its press office, I was told that the party “is confident of the case it has presented to the court”. But it refused to answer my questions about the suit’s justification or cost, or the political damage it may inflict. I suspect there is a performative aspect to this lawsuit: “Look how decisively we reject the Corbyn era!” And perhaps it has developed a momentum of its own – so much money has already been spent that it is hard to pull out. But its costs can only escalate, while its chances of success seem only to diminish. Once again, factional warfare seems to take precedence over winning an election.

The shame of the Labour party – the Labour party! – being put into special measures by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for racism shocked most members to the core in 2020. To be released from that disgrace now is hardly a moment for celebration, after the EHRC’s original finding that Labour acted unlawfully in failing to rein in antisemitism under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. he shame of the Labour party – the Labour party! – being put into special measures by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for racism shocked most members to the core in 2020. To be released from that disgrace now is hardly a moment for celebration, after the EHRC’s original finding that Labour acted unlawfully in failing to rein in antisemitism under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. His refusal to accept the overall findings set Corbyn on an inevitable path out of the parliamentary Labour party. He maintains “The scale of the problem was dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media.” But a party can’t be a little bit racist: the damning findings had to be swallowed whole. Keir Starmer’s confirmation today that Corbyn cannot stand as a Labour candidate at the next general election is hardly surprising. Cleansing the party of antisemitism is deeply personal for Starmer, as his wife is Jewish and they keep Jewish festivals. But Corbyn’s obstinacy was convenient, too, his expulsion an opportunity to demonstrate Starmer’s mission to get a grip on the party. Rishi Sunak’s feeble jibes at Starmer for serving in Corbyn’s cabinet bounce off him now. Of course, as Starmer said yesterday today, it’s a job not quite done: when the Labour MP Kim Johnson got up at PMQs to call the Israeli government fascist, she had to apologise to the house promptly, under threat from the chief whip. Taking over the leadership during the Covid crisis, Starmer devoted his time to fixing the party internally as he slowly made progress with voters. Asked his mission, he declared it was “winning”. It has paid off handsomely as he soars in the polls. I am told that many reports from local meetings speak of the Corbynite influence fading, with some of his supporters leaving altogether or changing their mind as the party inches towards power. Starmer has been lucky in the total implosion of the Tories and lucky again with the resignation of Nicola Sturgeon: polling for all her likely successors is unimpressive, aiding Labour’s chances in Scotland. No opposition leader has ever scored as low in Ipsos’s polling as Corbyn’s -60 personal approval rating, with Michael Foot at -56, and Iain Duncan Smith and William Hague tied at -37. Corbyn benefited from his opponents’ disastrous campaign in 2017, though his personal rating trailed far behind both Theresa May’s and his own party’s popularity – Labour won 40% of votes to the Tories’ 42. 4%. Yet there are those who still see him as a saviour rather than a drag anchor: as the one who brought flocks of enthusiastic new members into the party, and prompted delighted chants of “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” at Glastonbury. He was betrayed by rightwingers in the party and brought down in 2019 by those who should have backed him, they say. The Guardian is often their chief villain. Whenever I write criticism of the government I am guaranteed Twitter and thread responses claiming that if only I, my colleagues and the paper had backed him, we wouldn’t be suffering this Tory era. A brief check in the archive would show that the only thing wrong with this analysis is that I, other columnists and the Guardian’s leader all urged voters to back Corbyn’s Labour party. How could we not, after a decade of brutal austerity, and given Boris Johnson’s unfitness for power? I backed just about every individual item in Labour’s 2019 manifesto: it was nothing like Michael Foot’s “longest suicide note in history”, which pledged to leave both the EU and Nato. Its obstacle was its implausible costings, with extra billions added during the campaign. But Labour’s worst problem was Corbyn himself, as voters feared his perceived lack of patriotism (prompted by, for example, his failure to sing the national anthem at a remembrance event) and told focus groups and pollsters they felt he was “not concerned about their issues” or “people like them”. Most voters never joined that misleading Glastonbury chorus. My own greatest anger with Corbyn him was over his refusal to campaign seriously against Brexit in the referendum. “Where is he?” I asked his advisers a couple of months before the vote. “He thinks the local elections more important,” was the unforgivable reply, when in truth he was a lexiter – a Bennite Brexiter. But because our monstrous election system offers only a binary choice, of course progressives of every hue had to back Labour against a nightmarish, sociopathic Tory leader. I never doubted that Corbyn would be a preferable prime minister to Johnson – the lowest of bars – but in 2019 he led Labour to its worst result since 1935. Now, Corbyn’s remaining believers cling to that last resort of all failed ideologues, the same refrain as the failing Brexiters’: we were betrayed. Corbyn seems likely to stand as an independent for Islington North, where Labour has an array of good would-be candidates. Groups within Labour such as Momentum may face a quandary, as they would automatically be expelled from the party if they campaigned for him against Labour. But in the present golden polling climate, it hardly matters who wins that one seat. What matters is that Labour has expunged the shame of the EHRC’s special measures. What matters, too, is that in its haste to escape the failure of Corbynism, Labour doesn’t overreach and purge anyone with anything original or interesting to say.

The oppression of the Uyghurs and other Turkic and Islamic minority people in China’s Xinjiang region has come into stark focus over the past five years. First, minorities were interned in “re-education facilities” for indeterminate periods. Then came evidence of Chinese “minders” being sent to live with Uyghur families and report on their behaviour, of checkpoints on pedestrian streets, face-scanning cameras, the enforced installation of state spyware on personal phones, forced controls on fertility and the closing or demolition of mosques and other religious sites. Throughout all this, a man named Erkin Tuniyaz has been a leading official in Xinjiang’s regional government, and an enthusiastic defender of this “Sinicisation” of Islam. Since 2021, he has been the formal leader of the entire region. Yet none of this stopped British Foreign Office officials from planning to meet  with Tuniyaz during a visit to London – a visit that has now been cancelled, after hurriedly arranged protests, condemnation by prominent politicians from the Labour and Conservative parties, and calls for his arrest under torture laws. News of the cancellation came not in an official announcement, but rather from the Inter-parliamentary Alliance on China, which tweeted that it had heard the news from government sources. This is characteristic of the whole affair: Tuniyaz’s visit was initially announced only in an email to activist groups , and his schedule was never published. The furtiveness of the planned visit implies that the Foreign Office was fully cognisant of how unwholesome it was. Tuniyaz is not a peripheral figure in the mistreatment of Xinjiang’s minority peoples. Indeed, he has been a vocal defender of the mass internment camps there. The British government was aware of this: it has previously condemned the mistreatment of Xinjiang’s minorities and sanctioned other Xinjiang officials – including Tuniyaz’s deputy, Chen Mingguo – for their roles in the outrages that parliament has recognised as a genocide. In return, China has sanctioned many of our politicians, activists and academics for speaking out about the situation in Xinjiang. That Tuniyaz is himself Uyghur is no irony. Rather, his role as chairman is a product of the Chinese state’s cynical use of complicit members of minority groups to provide a veneer of equality and representation to Beijing’s rule of Xinjiang. As elsewhere in China, the government is subordinate to the party. While Xinjiang’s chairmen have always been Uyghurs, the party secretaries to whom they are subordinate have – with a single exception in the 1970s – always been Han, China’s dominant ethnic group. Chairmen like Tuniyaz are simply the face of policies decided on by party secretaries. It is likely that it was intended that Tuniyaz play a similar role in his visit to London, which was only one of his intended stops in Europe to “discuss this situation in Xinjiang”. In the face of the backlash, these trips have also been cancelled. However, the fact that they were planned at all suggests that Beijing was hopeful that the attention of the world had moved elsewhere, and it could begin to put behind it the scrutiny it has faced over the treatment of the Uyghurs. Given the willingness of British officials to meet Tuniyaz, such hopes may not have seemed farfetched. The British government was slow to act on the abuses in Xinjiang from the start, imposing sanctions only after years of campaigning from brave Uyghur exiles and other human rights activists. Among those who attended a protest against Tuniyaz’s visit outside the Foreign Office on Monday was Rahima Mahmut, a longtime Uyghur activist, singer and translator. As with other vocal Uyghurs living in the west, her decision to speak out over the years has had terrible consequences – she can neither return home, for fear of arrest; nor contact her family there without putting them at further risk. Many Uyghurs living in the UK simply will not discuss Tuniyaz’s visit with journalists, fearful of drawing the attention of Beijing which, in its well-documented efforts to silence criticism from abroad, is fiercely engaged in efforts to control the discourse around Xinjiang. Tuniyaz’s planned visit can only be seen as a part of those efforts. The cancellation of Tuniyaz’s visit is testament to the bravery and commitment of those who fought against it. But it also attests to the inconsistency of Britain’s approach. There should have been no meeting to cancel in the first place – Tuniyaz, as a defender and an overseer of the abusive policies in Xinjiang, should not be allowed to walk the streets of London. As the protesters argued on Monday, the British government should be listening to their experiences rather than to the state propaganda pushed by representatives of Beijing. Had it done so, Tuniyaz would already be on the sanctions list, as he is in the United States. The claim, from the prime minister’s office, that the meeting was agreed to with the intention of making clear the UK’s “abhorrence over the treatment of the Uyghur people” makes little sense. The official British position is already clear, but it will remain unconvincing until those responsible for the mistreatment of Xinjiang’s Turkic and Muslim minorities know that they are not welcome here.

This was Facebook a few years ago, when plummeting engagement whipped the social media platform into a frenzy of desperate invitations and prompts. It’s Fresh Direct when you fill your basket with groceries and – I can’t recommend this enough, if you’re looking for the tiny high that comes from withholding – don’t check out, triggering a bunch of wheedling automated messages, begging you to come back. This week, in my life, it’s Uber Eats. For the past couple of years I’ve ordered from them once a week and now I’ve stopped, causing the food delivery service to issue a flurry of semi-hysterical special offers. Each spam text, each begging notification, reminds me of the money I’m saving. If you like rejecting things (I like rejecting things) then this exercise will thrill you: rejection without the human cost of hurting someone’s feelings. The bigger picture, obviously, is a consumer trend away from the convenience-related services that surged during the pandemic. Companies that boomed and attracted millions in investment are starting to wither as our online habits change. In the US, instant delivery startups such as Buyk and Jokr, which briefly boomed in 2021, are declaring bankruptcy or pulling out of the US market. The meal-kit company Blue Apron has seen its share price plunge as food costs have risen and consumer interest in pricey convenience products has dwindled. The same goes for Stitch Fix, a service for clothing delivery that briefly boomed during the pandemic. And all of this in the context of mass lay-offs in tech at a time when those companies, seemingly, have nowhere left to expand. Though it may be bad for the economy, from the perspective of an individual trying to have a life that entails leaving the house, this trend is perhaps an encouraging sign. The same encouragement might be taken from the slowdown at Netflix; many of us are capped out after too many hours of watching TV. I’m not exactly out there every morning taking invigorating walks, but I am reading again, feeling more inclined to work rather than pass out on the sofa, and to seek out real-world rather than online experience. If habits inculcated during the pandemic were supposed to augur the future, as Derek Thompson wrote in the Atlantic last month, “the post-pandemic economy has been much weirder than most people anticipated”.For me, the weirdest of these impulses has been a desire to return to supermarket shopping. This is partly money-related; the downturn in fast-food delivery earnings is clearly linked to pinched household incomes. It’s also a health thing; many of us are still trying to reverse the damage done by all the junk food we ate during lockdown. But of all the habits adopted in the past couple of years, it seemed as if grocery delivery might be the obvious keeper. Post-pandemic, maybe no one wants a hulking great Peloton in their living room and the appeal of the third place – be it the gym or Starbucks – is enjoying an obvious bounce-back. But supermarket shopping, at least in New York where I live, has rarely been a pleasure. It has always been time-consuming, stressful and over-crowded, with in-store prices not much lower than what you pay for delivery. And yet, every Monday, I feel compelled to stand in line at Trader Joe’s, and stagger home carrying six bags of shopping. All I can put this desire down to is a combination of the small satisfaction that comes from making even minor economies in the present climate; and something less tangible to do with the joy, withheld during those two years of disruption, of going to a place and doing a thing. The expense of energy has itself become a virtue. Its inverse – ordering in; falling back on convenience and paying for it – seems not only to belong to a sadder period but, at this point, when one can go out, using one’s actual body, to feel like a moral failing. If it’s a hair shirt, perhaps it feels good simply in contrast to our pandemic wardrobe. Meanwhile, I suspect watching Uber Eats freak out will never get old. Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist If we are what we eat, what we drink says a lot about us too. We glean French sophistication from champagne. The name is in the drink for Scotch, but don’t forget Irn-Bru. Try Guinness in Ireland and the insanely extra-strong foreign version of Guinness in Nigeria. So the drink is you: a reflection of your life, your outlook, maybe your ancestors. That is, unless the drink is Lilt, would-be “taste of the tropics”. Soon to be discontinued by manufacturer Coca-Cola and relaunched as Fanta pineapple and grapefruit. No longer “totally tropical”.Everything must change, they say – but can’t say we’ll miss it. Lilt was a pineapple, grapefruit and mainly sugar-based drink created in 1974 in that good ol’ palm tree-laden, surf and sunshine paradise called the United Kingdom, just 5,000 miles away from “the tropics”, ie the Caribbean, the area it came to symbolise. Almost every aspect of Lilt, in a marketing sense, embodied and embraced Blackness, and specifically, Black Caribbeanness. Over its five decades of existence, Lilt adverts served up images of delightfully relaxed photogenic white people drenched in the sun of the “tropics” while happy Black people ensured they had a steady supply of Lilt to keep them refreshed – while a reggae track boomed in the background. Following in the tradition of Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima, in the late 80s Lilt gave us The Lilt Man – a happy Caribbean man driving around on what looked like a milk float delivering Lilt (mainly to delighted white people).By the late 90s Lilt had taken another cultural shift with its own version of Diamond and Silk, the conservative Black female vlogging duo who raised the cheerleading flag for Donald Trump. Lilt’s charming non-Trumpian equivalent was Hazel &amp; Blanche (one of whom described drinking Lilt as the most fun she had with her clothes on).By 2003, the once racially dubious yet somewhat wholesome Lilt adverts had taken a rather sexualised turn – with one advert showing a group of great-looking, bikini-clad women joining a man in a hot tub – who inexplicably pours Lilt over all of them. Lilt and the 2020s couldn’t coexist for long, for authenticity sells, and Lilt could not have been less authentic as a “taste of the tropics” if it wore fake dreadlocks and called itself Bob Marley Brew. It was the soft drink equivalent of blackface; a liquid echo of a variety show limbo dance. In a social media-driven age where accusations of cultural appropriation can spell doom for a brand and its manufacturer, authenticity seems more and more essential. Coca-Cola has not revealed why it is pulling the brand, but one thing cannot be denied: when the cash register stops ringing, corporations start moving. Lilt had clearly, to coin a phrase, faded to black. But then, who needs Coke’s totally synthetic tropical these days when you can enter a Caribbean food shop and leave with coconut water (delicious and good for the heart and kidneys), sop juice (high in vitamin C, good for the immune system), Malta (like Supermalt, but less sweet, said to lower cholesterol), sorrel (made from hibiscus calyces, fruits and spices – full of antioxidants) and myriad fruit juices adjacent to actual sun-kissed fruit. And for those who truly yearn for the carbonated taste of the Caribbean they got from Lilt, scout around: some places sell Ting, Lilt’s fizzy veteran competitor, flavoured with Jamaican grapefruit juice concentrate. It cultural but it’s business. All of this is business. Lilt, a brand once honed and pitched at Blackness and the tropics, has been rebirthed as a subbrand of Fanta – which was originally created to serve a Nazi Germany deprived of Coca-Cola. Go figure!

It’s not very often one gets to say this, but on Friday, I danced on national television. It was for Channel 4’s The Last Leg, the weekly chatshow hosted by Adam Hills.

It was for Channel 4’s The Last Leg, the weekly chatshow hosted by Adam Hills. If dancing for the nation on TV is a rarity for most people, it’s all the more so for me – as well as being a professional dancer, I’m also a disabled wheelchair user. It had been an exhausting day. I manage various chronic conditions that require taking more than 20 types of medication a day. I even had to rehearse some of the dance lying down. When I arrived back at the hotel room, with my dance partner and my carer, my legs were shaking badly and I had to be transferred out of my wheelchair. All for one minute on TV. It was 3am when, having managed to settle in bed, I became aware of the hateful comments coming in on Twitter. I’ve dealt with these types of comments before. Someone once suggested that I bought my wheelchair as a “prop”, and I’ve even been reported for benefit fraud for being a disabled dance teacher in the past. But I always hope, perhaps naively, that keeping doing what I do will lead to change. I knew my appearance on the show would cause some issues. I’m an ambulatory wheelchair user, meaning that I can use my legs in limited, particular circumstances. For the dance routine on TV, I was in my wheelchair and moving my legs. And let me tell you, trolls do not like disabled people moving limbs, especially when it could be linked to one of their favourite programmes: just this month, there was a hateful online backlash to the news that Strictly Come Dancing is hoping to have a celebrity wheelchair-using contestant this year. I became a wheelchair user at the age of 15, around a year after I received a diagnosis of ME. ME is a poorly understood condition to begin with, so when I became a wheelchair user with ME, I felt as if I had hit a double-whammy. I was regularly told I was “lazy” or “faking it” because my condition was so variable. Even now, people often don’t believe I’m unwell because they only see me at my best. Later in my teens, I was diagnosed with another condition, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. I’ve had a lot of complications from this condition and because of this, I use a powerchair (an electric wheelchair). It completely baffles people that my mobility aids change depending on the day. I can go from having to have a fully reclined powerchair one day, to walking into a coffee shop with my assistance dog the next, to then being virtually unconscious for a full day because I’m so unwell. The variability of my condition is something that I know a lot of society doesn’t understand. The truth is, I don’t really understand it either. All I ask is for people to be respectful. I’m 28, so I have spent half my life non-disabled and the other half disabled – how I was treated as a dancer before I was disabled is totally different from today. Many ambulatory wheelchair users are scared to use their equipment because of the prejudice surrounding it. More importantly, users tend to not be eligible for crucial support, such as suitable equipment on the NHS (wheelchairs included) and benefits. Statistics show one out of three wheelchair users is ambulatory. Many of these people will have variable conditions and can also fluctuate between needing to use different mobility aids, or needing complete rest. Disability prejudice is still very much alive, but one thing is certain. The disabled community has built an incredible support system for themselves and together we are strong enough to make a change. Hopefully, there will have been people watching the dance last Friday who will have had their preconceptions around disability challenged, reacting not with scepticism or hate, but a newfound awareness.

The name of this chilling global movement? The “15-minute city”.Westminster can often seem like a badly scripted spoof of itself, but rarely has parliament descended into parody as far as it did last week, when the Conservative MP for the South Yorkshire constituency of Don Valley, Nick Fletcher, launched a plucky tirade against the concept of convenient, walkable neighbourhoods. “Will the leader of the house please set aside time for a debate on the international socialist concept of so-called 15-minute cities and 20-minute neighbourhoods?” he asked, in an ominous tone. “Sheffield is already on this journey, and I do not want Doncaster, which also has a Labour-run socialist council, to do the same.”It is not the first time that an online conspiracy theory has made it into the Commons chamber, but it may be one of the most surreal. Simply put, the 15-minute city principle suggests you should have your daily needs – work, food, healthcare, education, culture and leisure – within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from where you live. It sounds pleasant enough, but in the minds of libertarian fanatics and the bedroom commentators of TikTok, it represents an unprecedented assault on personal freedoms.“Creepy local authority bureaucrats would like to see your entire existence boiled down to the duration of a quarter of an hour,” warned a furious presenter on GB News last week, as if describing a plot line from Nineteen Eighty-Four. The 15-minute city, he suggested, was a “dystopian plan”, heralding “a surveillance culture that would make Pyongyang envious”.Never before has a mundane theory of urbanism been such a lightning rod for outrage. It’s like suggesting that public parks are part of a sinister plant-worshipping plot to demolish our homes and replace them with grass. Or that public transport is the work of a satanic bus cult. Some online forums have claimed that the 15-minute city represents the first step towards an inevitable Hunger Games society, in which residents will not be allowed to leave their prescribed areas. They see it not as a route to a low-traffic, low-carbon future, but as the beginning of a slippery slope to living in an open-air prison. As one irate TikToker shrieked, while jumping around his room in disbelief: “You’re going to have to apply for a fucking permit to leave your zone!” (Although he also ascribed the 15-minute city plans to the Tories, so it’s not quite clear which deranged Reddit forum he got his information from).There are lots of good reasons to interrogate the cute logic of the 15-minute city – could it actually lead to further social segregation? Would wealthy residents, and their money, remain in the prosperous enclaves? Who is providing the services and where do they live? – but the threat of our rights being curtailed by travel permits isn’t one of them. The conspiracy theory pot was given a powerful stir in December, when the Canadian rightwing culture warrior Jordan Peterson decided to get involved. “The idea that neighbourhoods should be walkable is lovely,” he tweeted, in a post that has since clocked up 7. 5m views. “The idea that idiot tyrannical bureaucrats can decide by fiat where you’re ‘allowed’ to drive is perhaps the worst imaginable perversion of that idea,” he continued, “and, make no mistake, it’s part of a well-documented plan.” Peterson quoted a tweet that featured the telltale hashtag #GreatReset, referring to the World Economic Forum’s post-pandemic economic recovery plan – widely used in the stranger corners of the internet as a byword for a shadowy global conspiracy intent on robbing us of our freedoms. The anti-vaccine, pro-Brexit, climate-denying, 15-minute-phobe, Great Reset axis is a strong one. So where did the fear come from? Many of the UK conspiracy theorists highlight that these “un-British” ideas of urban walkability emanate from France, so they must be distrusted on principle. Worse than that, they point out, the ideology has been driven by a bearded Colombian scientist with radical roots. The ideas had been around since the 1920s, but the 15-minute city phrase was coined by Carlos Moreno, esteemed professor at the Panthéon-Sorbonne in Paris, who was once a member of a leftwing guerrilla group in the 1970s. And now he’s coming for your cars.“Their lies are enormous,” Moreno said in a recent interview , describing some of the claims made by his critics. “You will be locked in your neighbourhood; cameras will signal who can go out; if your mother lives in another neighbourhood, you will have to ask for permission to see her, and so on,” adding that they “sometimes post pictures of concentration camps.”Moreno first promoted his concept of la ville du quart d’heure in 2016, but it gained international attention when the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, adopted it as part of her re-election campaign in 2020. She promised she would close off roads and turn them into public plazas, plant more trees and turn schools into the “capitals of the neighbourhood”, open to everyone for sports and recreation in evenings and at weekends. The pandemic proved to be a powerful trial for how a 15-minute city might work in practice, and led to bodies such as UN Habitat, the World Economic Forum, the C40 Global Cities Climate Network and the Federation of United Local Governments championing the cause – which also helped to boost unhinged fantasies that it is all part of a grand global scheme of totalitarian oppression. More recently, the principles have gained traction in the UK, with Oxford, Birmingham, Bristol, Canterbury and Sheffield councils considering 15-minute city ideas. Cue outrage from those with no other cause left to flog. “The climate change lockdowns are coming,” tweeted Nigel Farage, in response to Canterbury’s innocuous traffic filtering scheme, while Oxford’s plans triggered similar ripples of incredulous fury.“Oxfordshire County Council yesterday approved plans to lock residents into one of six zones to ‘save the planet’ from global warming,” screamed one alarmist headline. “The latest stage in the ‘15-minute city’ agenda is to place electronic gates on key roads in and out of the city, confining residents to their own neighbourhoods.” The claims had zero basis in fact, but they poured further fuel on the fire of those battling low-traffic neighbourhoods, and their fellow band of assorted culture warriors. It seems fitting that a leaflet drop warning against Oxford’s traffic filters plan was organised by Not Our Future – a new pressure group led by none other than Fred and Richard Fairbrass of 1990s band turned anti-vaxxers Right Said Fred.
